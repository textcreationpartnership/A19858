            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And beginning firſt with a litle Treatiſe againſt them of the <hi>Separation</hi> in the defence of our <hi>Miniſtery, Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> (mooued thereunto by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all griefe and vexation my ſoule was in, to ſee ſo many round about me to ſeperate) I conſidered that they keepe much adoe about <hi>a true viſible Church, and a falſe,</hi> accuſing vs euer and anone to be <hi>a falſe Church.</hi> Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I thought it very requiſit rather to examine their doctrine of the Church, (which I found to be the very foundation of all that they haue written in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and to make triall whether that were true or falſe.</p>
            <p>I knowe that many will be apt to imagine, that I haue ſaide litle or nothing againſt the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration:</hi> becauſe I doe not in this booke anſwere their
<pb facs="tcp:18048:3"/> obiections touching our <hi>Miniſtery, Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> But theſe men forget, that the maine point of controuerſie betwixt the <hi>Separiſts</hi> and vs, is: <hi>Whether our Church be a true, or a falſe Church.</hi> If <hi>the Church of England be a true Church,</hi> as wee confidently affirme: Then is the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſeparation (by their owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) ſinfull: the Scriptures alleadged by them to that ende peruerted; their ſpeeches againſt our Church blaſpheamous; and all their arguments concerning our <hi>Miniſtery, Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> ſo many ſophiſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Then alſo, is their ealling vpon men, <hi>to ſeparate from vs,</hi> and to goe out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> no more to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then the barking of dogges in the ſtreete. But if <hi>our Church be a falſe Church,</hi> which they contend for: then we acknowledge their ſeperation to be lawfull, and their reaſons concerning our <hi>Miniſterie, Liturgie,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> to be found and ſubſtantiall. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon then all doth reſt, as a houſe vppon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which being ouerturned, the whole houſe (we know) fales to the ground. To this end I haue in this Treatiſe endeuored two things principally. Firſt, by diuers argumentes I proue that the church of England is a true Church, and our pariſh aſſemblies (as they are conſtituted by law) true viſible Churches. Secondly, I haue anſwered their Argumentes, whereby they would proue it to be a falſe church, and namely thoſe which lately and at large are by <hi>M.

            <p>Let none of my elder brethren be offended at this I haue done. What though this cauſe be not by me ſo well mannaged as it deſerues. Accept of it neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. I haue done my beſt: and God requireth but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. Let not man deſire more. If any demaund
<pb facs="tcp:18048:4"/> of me, why I, the moſt vnfit and vnable of a thouſand, in the middeſt of ſo many great Diuines, famous for learning, haue vndertaken <hi>the defence of our Church,</hi> which had well beſeemed the chiefeſt of them: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that ſeeing them ſilent, I could not hold my peace.

Their diſeaſe is almoſt incurable. For ſay that they be conuinced, and in themſelues doe condemne that which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for: Yet are they vſually ſo peruerſe and obſtinate as they will continue ſtill in their ſinne, maintaining their opinion againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

And doe we not in experience ſee, how hard a thing it is to draw men from error, to the loue and imbracing of the truth? Be they Turkes, Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, or whoſoeuer that bee wrapt in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? Certainely it is as eaſie a matter to draw couetous men from the deſire of riches, voluptuous men from the loue of pleaſure; the proud man from his pride, and the drunkard from his drunkennes:
<pb facs="tcp:18048:6"/> as to bring a man intangled in errour, to receiue and acknowledge the truth. Of the former ſort of theſe, if they haue continued long in their ſinne, the Prophet ſaith thus: <hi>Can the Blacke-Moore change his skin?</hi>

               <hi>or the Leopard his ſpots? Then may ye alſo doe good, that are accuſtomed to euill.</hi> The ſame is no leſſe true of all ſuch who haue dwelt and abide long in their errours. Beware therefore and feare (my deare brethren and countreymen) to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill in your ſchiſme and errours, and hearken to the counſell of <hi>Salomon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 19.27.</note> 
               <hi>My ſonne heare no more the inſtruction that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to erre from the words of knowledge.</hi> Goe not, I beſeech you in the name of Ieſus, one ſtep more forward in the way you are in. For I call heauen and earth to record, that it leades to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And why will ye die, O ye children of men? It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God: for our God is a conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>I know you perſwade your ſelues of better things, and ſuch as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany ſaluation. You think that the way you now are in, is the only way to life. But what if you miſtake it? Chriſt telleth vs, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall ſeeke to enter in at the ſtraight gate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 13.24.</note> 
               <hi>and ſhall not bee able.</hi> Which cannot be vnderſtood of men minding earthly things, whether it be their profits, or pleaſures. For they neither deſire, nor ſeeke after any ſuch thing. But of heretickes, Schiſmatickes, and ſectaries. You will ſay (I know) that you are no ſchiſmatickes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſeparate from a falſe Church onely, and ioyne to a true, in deede if that which you teach of the viſible Church were true, then were all our congregations falſe Churches. But heare and marke well what I ſay. Such a viſible Church as you require, and pretend to be, there is not in the world, neither euer was: You teach in this point that which is repugnant to the Scriptures, and a thing vnpoſſible in it ſelfe to be. Such a ſocietie as you ſay a true viſible Church is, is not viſible, cannot poſſibly be ſeene or diſcerned.</p>
            <p>But ſome of you will ſay: are not our Miniſters learned? Yes. That lets not but that both they may, and indeede doe groſſely erre in thoſe things wherein they diſſent from vs, and from all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the world. Who knoweth not that among the Papiſts there be many of great learning and gifts: which haue very great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and skill in the arts, in the languages, are of excellent vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, expert and ready in holy Scriptures; can ſpeake and write
<pb facs="tcp:18048:6"/> truely, agreeing with the Scriptures, of ſundry of the ſecrets of the Kingdome of heauen: as of God, his nature, perſons, attributes: Of Chriſt Ieſus his incarnation, his birth, life, preachings, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, comming to iudgement, of the Reſurrection, of the life to come, with many more of this kinde: and yet notwithſtanding in thoſe points wherein they differ from the Church of England, and all other true Churches: they are blinde as beetles.</p>
            <p>But you will obiect further, that what you of the Separation hold is proued plentifully out of the word of God, I acknowledge indeede that you abound and ſuperabound in your allegations of Scripture, Neuer any men contending for lyes, did therein goe beyond you, nor equall you neither. If hereunto we adde their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall holineſſe: wee may ſafely ſay, that in no faction or ſchiſme that euer yet was in the world, Satan did more transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into an Angell of light then in this. But what? Their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being peruerted, as the truth is, and ſo tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Reader: all this is but ſheepes clothing,<note place="margin">Mat 7.15.</note> whereof Chriſt biddeth vs to beware. Horrible and fearefull is your abuſing and wreſting of holy Scripture, and to ſome incredible. It had been well for you if you had been more ſparing in your quotations: then had yee leſſe taken Gods Name in vaine: who will not hold you guiltleſſe for the ſame, except ye repent.</p>
            <p>And now dearely beloued: behold, Chriſt Ieſus ſtands at the doore and knockes aloud, tarrying and abiding there, as one very deſirous to come in, and loth to be kept out He that hath the keyes of the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſhutteth and no man openeth: and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and no man ſhutteth: open the doore of your ſoule, that you may let Chriſt enter in. And to that end open I humbly beſeech you the eyes of your minde, that you may bee able to diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene things that differ, and know truth from falſehood: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting and abhorring the one, which is from the Diuell; may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the other, which is from God.</p>
            <p>And here my deare countrimen, who lately are gone out from vs, and become Anabaptiſts, I beſeech you, conſider of this one thing with me. When you firſt ſeparated from the Church of England, did not you highly eſteeme and reuerence the Church of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> euen as the deare ſpouſe and body of Chriſt?<note place="margin">I meane the Browniſts Church there.</note> Would not you then gladly haue had communion with them if poſſibly you could,
<pb facs="tcp:18048:7"/> when you refuſed the ſame with vs? Did not then all of you aſſure your owne ſoules that that way which then and ſtill we call <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> was the onely way to life wherevpon in that way you would needs walke, come on it what would, impriſonment or baniſhment; life or death? Did not then ſome of the chiefe of you in my hearing, magnifie M. <hi>Fr. Iohnſon,</hi> and their bookes ſpecially the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> aboue all bookes next to the holy Bible? And in all this you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced exceedingly. How commeth it now to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſſe, that ſo quickly, not onely our Churches, but the aforeſaid Church at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> is likewiſe become an Harlot and Babylon? That you abhorre now as much to haue religious communion with them, as with vs? How commeth this (I ſay) to paſſe, but becauſe that which the Apoſtle ſaith generally of all deceiuers, is and muſt needs be in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar true of you, your ſelues being deceiuers: That you <hi>wax worſe and worſe: deceiuing, and being</hi> more and more <hi>deceiued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I in few words, by way of commination, exhortation, dehortation, and ſupplication indeuoured to perſwade you my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Separation, (ſpeecially my countreymen, who are lately entred into this way,) to renounce your errours, and to breake off by repentance your grieuous ſinne of <hi>ſeparating,</hi> and all the ſinnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it. If this I haue publiſhed preuaile not thus farre, (though not with all, yet with ſome of you) as to bring you to the ſight and acknowledgement of your erronious doctrine concerning <hi>the viſible Church,</hi> and your peruerting of holy Scripture for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof, as my hope is it will. I for my part doe confeſſe that I vtterly deſpayre of doing any good of you: and ſay to you as I haue learned from the Apoſtle to ſpeake in this caſe: <hi>If any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</hi> I ſhall alſo hold it vaine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any further with you.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.38. &amp; 11.16.</note> 
               <hi>If any luſt to be contentious,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) wee haue no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God:</hi> And ſo I end, leauing the ſucceſſe hereof, both with you and others to the Lord: whom in Ieſus Chriſt I beſeech, to accept of this my poore and weake ſeruice, and to grant that it may proſper to that end, wherevnto by me his moſt vnworthy ſeruant it is intended: euen to the glory of his great Name, and edification of his Church, <hi>Amen.</hi>

When once the Spirit of God regenerateth and dwelleth in one of theſe, (which in the appointed ſeaſon he doth in them all, and only in them) then ceaſeth he to be prophane, and beginneth to be holy; and forthwith becommeth of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, a ſpirituall man; and a Saint of a ſinner, and is from thenceforth ſo to be called: man hauing his denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the more principall, or of that which is in him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18048:20"/> which likewiſe we cal Churches. So learned men ſpeake of the Eaſt Church, and the Weſt Church, the Greek Church, and the Latine Church. In like manner ſay we at this day, the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Church of France: none of theſe or the like are Catholike or Vniuerſall. This is ſaid after the very ſame ſort, as when we ſpeake of ſome parts of the Ocean ſea; we call them the Sea, as the South ſea, the North ſea, the Brittiſh ſea, &amp;c. And wee giue them all the name of Ocean: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee know that there is but one Ocean, and not many: of the which, by theſe names we make many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, becauſe it is but one vniforme body, from which the vnity may bee diſtinguiſhed, but not diuided: And ſo alſo muſt the vnity of the Church be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. When therefore wee ſpeake of all the Chriſtians and profeſſors of true religion in a Nation, as in England, Scotland, France, &amp;c. we may rightly ſay the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Church of France: yea thus meaning, we cannot properly, and fitly ſay, The Churches of England, &amp;c. in the plurall number.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what we call the Catholike or Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Viſible Church: euen the Congregation of all thoſe that doe profeſſe true Religion, throughout the whole world: diſtinguiſhed (as hath beene ſaid) into many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches: All which together make but one body. And in this ſence, the word <hi>Church,</hi> is diuers times vſed in the ſacred Scriptures, as partly appeareth before we call it <hi>Catholike,</hi> becauſe, as one ſaith, it is <hi>vbique diffuſa,</hi> ſpread euery where, ſcattered farre and wide ouer all the world. And <hi>viſible,</hi> it is ſaid to be, <hi>quia rationabilis,</hi> becauſe it is conceaueable by reaſon: It is not ſo much ſeene with the eye, though it be called viſible, <hi>quam intellectu, mente, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione: as with the vnderſtanding, the minde, and the reaſon,</hi> as is well ſaid by one.</p>
               <p>When this word <hi>Church</hi> is taken ſtrictly, and not in ſo large, and generall ſence as before: it is vſed eyther more, or leſſe ſtrictly, when it is taken in the ſtricteſt ſignification, and for the leaſt company, thereby is meant eyther <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18048:21"/> of the Church,</hi> and ſo it is vſed twice in one verſe, Matth. 18.17. <hi>If hee refuſe to heare them, tell it vnto the Church, and if he refuſe to heare the Church alſo, let him be vnto thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican:</hi> Or <hi>all the Chriſtians in a family or one houſe.</hi> And ſo it is vſed in theſe places following,<note place="margin">Colloſ. 4.15. 1.

               </p>
               <p>Leſſe ſtrictly, and then it is taken, for <hi>all that company which in a Citie, Towne, or Villages cohabiting, profeſſe the Chriſtian or true Religion, and doe ordinarily meet and ioyne together in the exerciſes of Religion.</hi> This particular <hi>Church</hi> we call a <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and being met together to ioyn in prayer, in hearing of the Word, and receiuing the Sacraments: <hi>A Pariſh aſſembly:</hi> which is a company of Chriſtians, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſuch a circuite as we call a Pariſh aſſembled in one place, for religious exerciſe.

As I teach euery where in euery Church.</hi> As if a Miniſter of the Goſpell ſhould now ſay thus: This is my opinion, and ſo I teach euery where, in euery Pariſh whereſoeuer I come. <hi>If therefore, when the whole Church is come together in one: and all ſpeake ſtrange tongues, there come in they that are vnlearned:</hi> tis as if one ſhould ſpeak now, when the whole Pariſh is come together:<note place="margin">Act. 14.23. and 27.</note> 
                  <hi>And when they had ordained them Elders by election in euery Church,</hi> that is (as we ſay) in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Pariſh, and prayed and faſted, <hi>they commended them to the Lord.</hi> Behold then many Churches, and one Church; many particulars, but one vniuerſall.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that the word <hi>(Church)</hi> in holy Writte, is often taken for <hi>a company of men profeſsing Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> whether that company be great or ſmall, that is all one. Sometimes in the Scripture, the whole company of men that profeſſed Chriſtian Religion throughout the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18048:21"/> world, that is, the vniuerſall Congregation of Chriſtians, is called a Church: Of that company of Chriſtians, that ordinarily ioyned together in the exerciſes of Religion; and ſometimes the Chriſtians that were of the ſame fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And from hence, by very good reaſon, wee may well call all that profeſſe Chriſtian or true Religion in a Nation, or all the Chriſtians in a Nation, the Church of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoeuer it be. Let no man therefore hold that it is vnlawfull to ſay, The Church of England, the Church of Scotland, &amp;c. as ſome of late haue done. And thus much concerning the Church, what it ſignifieth, and what it is. It remaineth that we be further inſtructed touching <hi>the viſible Church,</hi> that ſo we may the better know it, and be able to diſcerne betweene a true viſible Church, and a falſe; betwixt the Church of God, and the Sinagogue of Satan: That ſo to our further comfort, or diſcomfort, we may know to which of theſe we doe belong.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18048:25"/> and bringeth forth fruit vpward: ſo at other times, and in ſome other Churches, it may ſo fall out, that nine parts thereof be bad, and onely a tenth good, nay, why may not nineteene parts or more be naught, and but the twentieth part good, and yet be <hi>Churches of the Saints,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 22.14.</note> All that be and remaine vnder the voice and call of God, (that is, the Miniſtery of the Word, whereby God ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his hands, crieth aloud, and calleth vpon the children of men, that they would repent and beleeue, and ſo bee ſaued) bee of the viſible Church. Of this Church Chriſt telleth vs, the number being great, that yet few ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be good, and ſuch as ſhal be ſaued. Me thinks that none of vnderſtanding ſhould deny that the former of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions <hi>(Many are called)</hi> is to be vnderſtood of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and the latter <hi>(But few are choſen)</hi> of thoſe of the inuiſible Church, who are in the viſible. This latter none will deny, and the former is no leſſe true: which both the coherence or dependance of this verſe with that which goeth before, and alſo the very words doe euince, and it is as if in more words it were thus ſaid. That ſociety and company of men, whom God the Father inuiteth to the Marriage of his Sonne, to partake with him in his glory, and the ioyes of the Kingdome of heauen is very great, they be not a few, but many, to whom God maketh this offer and tender of ſaluation: nay <hi>calleth</hi> vpon, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with them, riſing rarely and late, (firſt by <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> then by <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> afterwards by <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their Succeſſors, Paſtors and Teachers) that they would be ſaued. But in all ages among this great multitude of Iewes and Gentiles, a few only be of Gods election, and ſuch as ſhall be ſaued. Hereupon (conſidering they who haue and enioy the external calling, are the viſible Church) it followeth ineuitably, that the moſt or greateſt part of the viſible Church are Reprobates, &amp; ſuch as are appointed to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18048:26"/> iuſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation. For if few in this great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church be elected, many are reiected. If now the moſt in the viſible Church be reprobates, then are they wicked and vngodly, how holy a profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoeuer they make. This ſhort ſpeech <hi>(Many are called but few are choſen:)</hi> our Lord vſeth diuers times, as Mat. 20.16. &amp; 22.14. not ſo much for the certainty thereof, as that we might the better learne, and remember the ſame being iterated, but chiefely that the faithfull might not bee offended, and ſtumble at the multitude of the wicked, and paucity of the godly in the Church: ſeeing it is no new or ſtrange thing, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtate and condition of the Church, ſo as ſeldome or neuer, it doth or can goe otherwiſe with the Church.

In the Inuiſible, there bee many ſheepe which are neuer gathered into the viſible (eſpecially) aſſembly or particular Congregation. In the Viſible, a great many Goats and Wolues which ſhall neuer be receiued into the Inuiſible.<note place="margin">Matth. 10.16.</note>

This is carefully to be obſerued againſt them of the Seperation.</p>
               <p>By that which hath beene ſaid it is manifeſt, that a true viſible Church conſiſteth of both kinds of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, of Chriſtians true and falſe, of Chriſtians indeed, and of Chriſtians in name only: no better indeed then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt God, and blaſphemers of him after whom they be called: and is a confuſed and mixt company of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Reprobates, good and bad, holy, and prophane, nay many times it is ſo ouerſpread with wicked, that the righteous can hardly bee diſcerned, no more then the wheate that lieth all hid vnder the chaffe: So that there is ſometime a Church without any ſhew of it. So was it in <hi>Eliah</hi> his time, who though a Prophet,<note place="margin">1.

Theſe things being ſo, what meane thoſe men, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time were of vs, to condemne our Churches, and publike aſſemblies for falſe Churches, becauſe of this mixture; and for this cauſe chiefely, to withdraw themſelues from vs; and our Aſſemblies.

Of a falſe Religion, and falſe worſhippers, are not onely the Turkes, (which none but themſelues deny) but the Papiſts likewiſe, which ſome men gain-ſay: becauſe their worſhip is not onely in matter of circumſtance, but in the ſubſtance falſe, and not commanded in the Word.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>True Religion,</hi> is that Religion, which teacheth the true way &amp; manner of worſhipping God, ſo as whoſoeuer wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in that way, &amp; worſhippeth God after that maner may be ſaued. And it is eyther <hi>pure,</hi> or <hi>corrupted.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 1.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Pure</hi> &amp; vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Religion,</hi> is, when the externall worſhip of God is in all things ſuch as the Word requireth: both in the matter and maner of worſhip; as wel in euery circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance, as in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Or, that is pure Religion, when God is worſhipped in all things as hee hath appointed, without adding any thing therto, or taking any thing from it. This is the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> men ſhould be of, and this is the worſhippe wee ſhould giue to God. But alas, partly through the blindnes that is in man, &amp; partly through his corruption otherwiſe: it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſeldom or neuer to paſſe, that men attaine to this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in Religion and worſhip. After this purity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we muſt ſtriue at the height &amp; perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; worſhip: &amp; if we cannot attaine vnto it, let vs yet draw as neere it as may be; knowing that by how much the nearer we approach thereunto, by ſo much the better is our Religion and worſhip: and by how much the further off we be remoued from it, by ſo much it is the worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>True Religion</hi> is then <hi>corrupted,</hi> when the body and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Diuine worſhip remaining ſound, ſome thing or things notwithſtanding, be eyther wanting therein, which God hath commanded, or vſed, which he hath not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or when both theſe are to be found in diuine worſhip. Such was the Religion and worſhip of the Iewes, when Chriſt was vpon the earth at which time, contrary to Gods appointment, they had two high Prieſts, <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas.</hi> And where the high Prieſts office was to continue during his life, they now held it but for a yeere. To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their exceeding great corruption in doctrine and manners: yet was the Religion and worſhippe of the Iewes at that time, the onely true Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, but not a pure Religion and worſhippe. The ſame is true of the Church of Corinthus, of the Churches of Galatia, and of the ſeuen Churches in Aſia. And ſuch is the Religion we profeſſe in England, and the worſhippe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18048:28"/> we giue to God, a true, but not a pure Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And of this kind alſo, wee may aſſure our ſelues, is the Religion of the Churches in Scotland, in France, in the Low-countries, yea euen of all the reformed Churches in Chriſtendome, though not all corrupted in the ſame degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>True Religion is corrupted leſſe or more.</hi> And that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as in diuine worſhip, is omitted more or leſſe of thoſe things which God hath appointed, or added and mixed therewith more or leſſe, which God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or both. As when any thing in Diuine worſhip is wanting, which God hath ordained, it is not pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and worſhip, but corrupted, though it may be a true Religion and worſhip: ſo when with Diuine worſhip are mixed,<note place="margin">Quaere de cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, temporis, habitus, geſtus, &amp;c.</note> or thereunto added ſome ceremonies (more or leſſe) and ordinances of mans deuiſing, which we call hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions: Religion then and worſhip are thereby corrupted, and cannot be ſaid to be pure and vndefiled. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe God hath not left it to the liberty and will of man, to ſerue and worſhip him as hee pleaſeth, and thinketh good: but as he alone will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, ſo in that manner as he (not man) hath appointed, and no otherwiſe. Nothing is left heere to the wit and will of man: he may neyther adde, nor omit any thing,<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 12.32. and 4.2. Prou. 30.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer I command you, take heed you doe it: thou ſhalt not adde vnto it, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> Hence it came to paſſe that<note n="b" place="margin">Leuit. 10.1.</note>

               <p>Thus you ſee the difference betweene pure Religion, and the pure worſhip of God; and true religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, corrupted. Alſo that a people may be of a true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and haue the true worſhip of God, and ſo be a true

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing now prepared and made a way to the Readers better vnderſtanding, I returne to my former deſcription: willing thee againe to remember, that I doe not ſay that a viſible Church is a company of people profeſſing the pure Religion of God, but a company profeſsing <hi>true Religion.</hi> Adde thereunto if you will, and enioying a true worſhip of God, though not a pure worſhip. And heere fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I may frame another deſcription of the viſible Church: <hi>That it is a company of men enioying and ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the true worſhip of God.</hi> Let there be an aſſembly ioyned together in prayer, in hearing the Word, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Sacraments<note n="a" place="margin">Touching the ſubſtance therof, though not in euery circumſtance, and in that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which ought to be.</note> according to Chriſts inſtitution, and it is a true viſible Church.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt ſoundly vnderſtand (Chriſtian Reader) what a true viſible Church is, and be preſerued from that errour and Schiſme, into which many of late haue fallen, thou muſt carefully obſerue and remember theſe two things. Firſt, The difference betweene pure Religion, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18048:29"/> true Religion corrupted: betwixt pure worſhip, and true worſhip corrupted, whereof we haue ſpoken. Secondly, That to the making or being of a member of the viſible Church, a profeſsion of true Religion, and an outward ſubmiſsion to true worſhip ſufficeth. From whence theſe concluſions doe follow. Firſt, That an Aſſembly may be a true viſible Church, though it profeſſe not the Religion that is pure and vndefiled, nor liue vnder a pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere worſhip of God, but ſuch as is partly impure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Secondly, That a man may be of the true viſible Church, though he be not religious and godly but indeed and in truth irreligious and prophane, ſo that he profeſſe the true Religion. And that ſuch may be, and are of the viſible Church, who only outwardly ſubmit themſelues to the true worſhip of God, though they be not true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, and doe not <hi>worſhip God in Spirit and truth.</hi> This <hi>profeſsion of the true Religion, and ſubmiſsion</hi> I ſpeake of, is all in all in this caſe. It is that which giueth life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to euery member vnited to his body: ſo as whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer maketh this profeſsion, and vſeth this ſubmiſsion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knit to this body, and not cut off by excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is in, and of the viſible Church. The matter of this Church is a company of men: not one, but a company, leſſe, or more. And yet not a company of Angels, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but of men. The forme is the profeſsion of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or ſubmiſsion to the true worſhip of God. As ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in all other caſes, that where the matter and forme of a thing is, there is the thing it ſelfe: euen ſo it is in this particular.</p>

                  <hi>That there are ſome who profeſſe they know God, but by workes deny him, and are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18048:29"/> abominable and diſobedient, and vnto euery good worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate. Seeing then a company of Reprobates may profeſſe all doctrine needfull to ſaluation, yet practiſe ſuch things as will bring them to damnation: We cannot be perſwaded though all your three markes were granted to be in your Pariſhes, that therefore they are true Churches of Chriſt; for we know they doe the workes of Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, Neyther Papiſts, nor Anabaptiſts, nor any falſe Church, or Sinagogue of Satan, profeſſe true Religion. They profeſſe indeed ſome true and ſound doctrine, yea the Diuell himſelfe did ſo; but it is another thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſe true Religion, and enioy and ſubmit our ſelues to true worſhip. But ſay you: <hi>A company of Reprobates may profeſſe, not only ſome but euen all doctrine needfull to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet practiſe ſuch things as will bring them to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we cannot therefore be perſwaded, that a company pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing Chriſtian Religion, make the Church of Chriſt.</hi> You ſpeake you know not what, for hereby you imply, and ſecretly teach, that <hi>A true viſible Church is a company of people profeſsing and practiſing ſuch things as will bring them to ſaluation.</hi> Whereupon it followes, that there is no Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in the viſible Church: for whoſe practiſe is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his holy profeſsion, he is no Hypocrite.

                  </gap>y, and ſuch as ſhall be ſaued. For all that practiſe ſuch things as will bring them to ſaluation, ſhall be ſaued. But this practiſe of holines, ouer and beſides an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſsion, doe you require in all the members of the true viſible Church: condemning them as no members that want it, and which making this profeſsion, doe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thoſe things which lead to damnation. Therefore by your Doctrine, all of the viſible Church ſhall be ſaued, and none therein damned. And thus vnawares you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the viſible and the inuiſible Church; but that is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall with you. In effect you affirme, that thoſe mentioned Titus 1.16. were without. But that is more then you or any man can proue. It is more probable that they were in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18048:30"/> the Church; for they were profeſſors. <hi>They profeſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that they know God.</hi> Vnder the knowledge of God, comprehending alſo their <hi>profeſsing</hi> to feare God, to loue him, and to beleeue in him, and to obey him. And I am very ſure, that notwithſtanding their extreame wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, they might be of the viſible Church, which onely maketh you thinke they were not of it. Whether thoſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> were in the Church, or without, it mattereth not. I am ſure, that if not theſe, yet infinite others, as abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as theſe, haue beene in, and of the viſible Church, as hereafter ſhall bee made manifeſt. Seeing then in many members of the viſible Church, as <hi>Cain, Iſmael, Eſau, Saul, Abſalom,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſies, with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble more, there was no practiſe at all of godlines, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a profeſſion thereof, being no better then Atheiſts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God, in their workes abominable, diſobedient, and to euery good worke Reprobate: why doe you neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require <hi>practiſe</hi> in al the members of the viſible Church, ſo as without it one cannnot be a member of the Church, and for want of practiſe condemne our Pariſhes for falſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches? Behold heere men deliuered vp to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſence, that were of the viſible Church. Are any in our Pariſhes worſe and more vile then theſe? Were theſe becauſe of their <hi>outward profeſsion</hi> of the true viſible Church, notwithſtanding their prophane liues. And may not they in our Pariſhes, making the ſame <hi>profeſsion,</hi> bee likewiſe members of the true viſible Church, albeit their liues be prophane, ſo long as by excommunication they be not caſt out of the Church? <hi>Your Pariſhes</hi> (ſay you) <hi>we cannot be perſwaded are the true Churches of Chriſt: becauſe they doe the workes of Antichriſt.</hi> Be it that we are guiltie of this treſpaſſe; that we doe ſome <hi>workes of Antichriſt,</hi> (that is) that ſome ſuch things wee doe, or yeeld vnto, as Antichriſt hath brought into the Church.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18048:30"/> thereof a good reaſon in theſe words: <hi>For the beſt Churches are ſubiect to errour, and ſome abominations of Antichriſt were crept into Chriſtian Churches while the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles liued.</hi> By this reaſon of yours, and your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, the Primitiue Churches were not true Churches.

               <p>But the <hi>Anſwere</hi> to Maſter <hi>Stone</hi> proceedeth, <hi>If you teach your people, that profeſsion without practiſe, is ſufficient to ſaluation, you are but a deceiuer of their ſoules.</hi> Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs teacheth ſuch diabolicall doctrine?

               <p>From the latter deſcription of a viſible Church, That it is <hi>a company of people enioying and ſubmitting themſelues to the true worſhippe of God,</hi> I argue yet further for our Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer people doe enioy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and outwardly ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the true worſhippe of God, they are a true viſible Church:</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore the people of England are a true viſible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition hath ſufficient confirmation from the aforeſaid deſcription of the viſible Church, and needeth not to be ſtrengthened any further; beſides you will not (I know) deny it, and therefore in vaine it were to vſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words about it.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:18048:32"/>
               <p>The Aſſumption you will and muſt needes deny, that <hi>our diuine worſhip, is true worſhip.</hi> For if our worſhippe be true worſhip, then is our Church a true Church: This you know full well.

                  <hi>Should we ſay</hi> (quoth Maſter <hi>Ainſworth) that a viſible Church is a people that falſely worſhip Chriſt? Indeed, if ſo we held we might well returne to their Church of England; for there is falſe worſhip more then enough.</hi> If we can proue now that our worſhip is true worſhip, then and thereby it will be manifeſt that our Church, is a true Church: and ſo the foundation of your building, will not only be ſhaken, but vtterly ouerthrowne, and fall to the ground, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole building. That the worſhip we enioy, and giue vnto God, is true worſhip, I thus proue.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the firſt is true:</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both the Propoſition and Aſſumption of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be made euident in and by the proſecution of the following Argument: where I proue that <hi>our Religion, is true Religion.</hi> If that forthwith following, which is ſaid <hi>of true Religion,</hi> thou wilt (Reader) apply vnto, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of true worſhip, then thou ſhalt plainely ſee that the ſame argument, whereby we proue our Religion to be true Religion, maketh as ſtrongly to proue our worſhip to be true worſhip. For if the Religion we profeſſe be true, then needs muſt the worſhip we giue to God be true: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion is nothing elſe, but the manner after which men worſhip God; and that true Religion, and true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as falſe Religion, and falſe worſhip; cannot be ſeuered: But the Religion, which we in England profeſſe, is true; as ſhall be proued: Therefore the worſhip we giue to God, is true worſhip. I now proceed to a third Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer people, all the Churches of God in the world,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The people of England, all the Churches of God in the world, doe acknowledge to be a true Church:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the people of England are a true Church, and ſo to be accounted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition I thus make manifeſt. we ſpeake of a viſible Church and ſo I meane by Church in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now if it cannot be diſcerned, and knowne by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is not viſible. If it can be diſcerned, then by the viſible Churches that are: to the members whereof wee cannot but grant this gift and ability, to diſcerne and know a true Church. It is abſurd to yeeld this gift to them, that are without: and therefore to bee granted, to them that are within the Church: vnleſſe we will deny it to all men, which is moſt abſurd of all.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption I proue by this induction. The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Scotland, France, Heluetia, Bohemia, Saxonie, and ſo of the reſt, doe acknowledge our Church for their Siſter, and giue vnto vs the right-hand of fellowſhippe; Therfore all the Churches in the world. If any true Church doe iudge otherwiſe of vs, doe you inſtance the ſame, and proue it accordingly. Vntill then, we will hold the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be as true, as the Propoſition, and the concluſion to bee no leſſe true then they. Thus much generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Church of England:</hi> now I will proue <hi>our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, or Pariſh aſſemblies, to be true viſible Churches:</hi> and firſt thus;</p>

                  <hi>The matter of a true viſible Church, is a company of men, and the forme of it is the profeſsion of the true Religion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That the matter of a Church, whether true or falſe, is a company of men, none I thinke, of iudgement will deny, or once doubt of: ſure I am, he may as well and truely deny, that water is moiſt.</p>
               <p>Touching the latter part of the Propoſition the forme: Who can with any face or colour of truth deny, That a Congregation, ioyning together in the profeſsion of true Religion, is a true viſible Church? In the 14. of the Acts we reade thus: <hi>And when they had ordained them Elders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>by election in euery Church, and prayed and faſted, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the Lord, in whom they beleeued.</hi> Certainly theſe Churches were diuers particular Congregations, each of which did ioyne together in the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion. Now I would know, what made theſe ſeuerall ſocieties, Churches, (euen by the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt) but their profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion? whereby they were diſtinguiſhed from all other ſocieties, as vſually things are by their formes. At this time, there was little or no Eccleſiaſticall Gouernment in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which ſome make the forme of the Church: becauſe there were no Elders, by which the ſame ſhould haue bin gouerned. Not this then, but their holy profeſſion gaue the forme and being to theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Aſſumption, that our particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations be companies of men, profeſſing true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the proofe thereof followeth forthwith.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, out of my former deſcription of the viſible
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18048:34"/> Church, which is demonſtrated by the word of God, to be a company of people profeſſing true Religion. I argue thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All particular Congregations which doe profeſſe the true Religion, are true viſible Churches:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our particular congregations, doe profeſſe the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore our particular Congregations are true viſible Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer Aſſemblies profeſſe the true way to ſaluation, the ſame be true viſible Churches:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Aſſemblies in England, doe profeſſe the true way to ſaluation:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Aſſemblies in England are true viſible Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition (or firſt part) of both theſe reaſons, is manifeſt by the former Doctrine, and deſcription of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church: the truth whereof hath beene made euident by ſundry teſtimonies of holy Scripture. The Aſſumption of the three laſt Arguments, (being the ſame in effect) I thus confirme:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If men profeſsing the ſame Religion, and way to ſaluation, that we doe, haue liuing and dying in that profeſsion beene ſaued, then is the Religion and way to ſaluation, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, the true Religion, and the true way to ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But men profeſsing the ſame Religion, and way to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with vs, haue therein beene ſaued:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Religion, and way to ſaluation we profeſſe, is the true Religion, and true way to ſaluation: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are a true viſible Church, and our Congregations the Churches of Chriſt, and not the Sinagogues of Satan, as theſe men blaſphemouſly ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition is very manifeſt, and needs no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation:<note place="margin">In the printed letters between M. Iacob, and M. Iohnſon paſsim.</note> the Aſſumption is true by your owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For you confeſſe, that thoſe who died for Religion in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time were <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and vſually you ſo call them, and therefore are they ſaued, and now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18048:34"/> and they profeſſed the very ſame Religion, and way to ſaluation with vs, and therein liued and died; yea, died for that Religion wee at this day profeſſe: Men therefore profeſsing the ſame Religion, and way to ſaluation with vs, haue therein beene ſaued by your owne acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>All that you heere ſay for your ſelues, or can ſay, is this; <hi>That the Martyrs ſaw no further.</hi> I reply, You herein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that ſo many among vs, as in theſe things ſee no further, are in the ſame eſtate with the Martyrs, ſaued, I meane, as well as they, if they walke according to their profeſsion, and that light is reuealed vnto them, as they did. Which being ſo, the Aſſumption remaineth firme and ſound. That many of the Martyrs did in theſe things ſee as farre, as many thouſands of priuate men doe at this day; nay, a great deale further, we cannot deny or doubt of, if we compare the knowledge of priuate Chriſtians (for the greateſt part) in theſe things, with the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs knowledge, ſhining in ſundry ſpeeches of theirs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded partly in the Acts of Monuments, and partly in ſome of their owne bookes. And yet did they not ſeperate from the publike aſſemblies, being as corrupt as ours: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Popery came in, whereby the ſubſtance of diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was corrupted, and abominable idolatry erected. And therefore men ſeeing and knowing many corruptions in our worſhip and Miniſtery, and yet not ſeperating from that worſhip, becauſe of them, may notwithſtanding bee ſaued: walking according to the rules of our Religion, and in that way to ſaluation we profeſſe. Otherwiſe I am ſure theſe men were not ſaued, which I hope you will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; nay in effect, you all teach the contrary, in that you acknowledge them to be <hi>Martyrs:</hi> and eſpecially Maſter <hi>Francis Iohnſon:</hi> who almoſt euery where in the printed letters betweene Maſter <hi>Iacob</hi> and him, calleth them <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;</hi> and pag. 75. and 77 <hi>holy Martyrs:</hi> who could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>Martyrs,</hi> nor Saints, if they were not ſaued, and now in heauen. Much more then may they among vs bee ſaued, who walking in this way, are ignorant of theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18048:35"/> though they doe not ſeperate: and therefore men profeſsing the ſame Religion, and way to ſaluation with vs, may be ſaued.</p>
               <p>And whereas they acknowledging them that died in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, to be <hi>Martyrs,</hi> deny vs to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> ſo many as <hi>ſtand members of our Pariſh aſſemblies,</hi> which generally we doe all; and granting to them ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deny it (in a certaine reſpect) to vs: that theſe cannot ſtand together, it ſhall appeare: Maſter <hi>Iohnſon</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his ſecond Exception againſt Maſter <hi>Iacob,</hi> page 16. hath theſe words;<note place="margin">Defence of the Churches and Miniſtery of England. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe men and aſſemblies, thus hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, profeſsing, and practiſing, cannot in this eſtate be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med true Chriſtians; and Churches.</hi> Againſt this I argue thus:</p>

                  <hi>If the late Engliſh Martyrs, profeſſed, and practiſed the very ſame Religion, wee now profeſſe, and yet were in that eſtate true Chriſtians, and ſo ſaued; then men at this day profeſsing, and practiſing our Religion, are true Chriſtians, and in the eſtate of ſaluation:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the late Engliſh Martyrs, profeſſed, and practiſed the very ſame Religion we now profeſſe, and in that eſtate were true Chriſtians, and ſo ſaued:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition muſt needs be true, except wee will make God mutable, or an accepter of perſons.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption (conſiſting of two parts) is likewiſe true; for all the Chriſtian world knoweth, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the very ſame Religion, that we now doe; and that they liued and died in our Religion, and for it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deny this, is extreame impudencie. The latter part of the Aſſumption, themſelues confeſſe to be true, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and acknowledging them for <hi>Martyrs,</hi> as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>If heere they roule ouer againe the ſame ſtone, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing elſe to ſay, obiect the ſecond time the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe times, that <hi>the Martyrs knew not the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that then were, and ſtill remaine in the worſhip, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18048:35"/> and Church gouernment;</hi> as all we either doe, or may know; I returne for anſwere, that howſoeuer this is true of ſome of the Martyrs, yet it is not true of them all. And what ſay they to them? were they <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and ſaued, or no? Maſter <hi>Hooper, Latimer, Bradford,</hi> with ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had more knowledge, and a deeper inſight, into the preſent corruptions, then many priuate Chriſtians haue at this day: nay it is not to be hoped that many among vs, illiterate, ſimple ones, of ſlender capacity, bad memories, as olde men and women, &amp;c. haue that knowledge of Church corruptions, as theſe and ſome other Martyrs had; who were learned men, Miniſters, and ſuch as ſpent their whole time and daies at their ſtudies. Shall we now deny Chriſtianity, and ſaluation to all theſe ſimple ones, and grant the ſame to the former, notwithſtanding the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of theſe perſons in the corruptions (and that not wilfull ignorance) is greater then of the others? Were the former ſaued, not ſeperating from the corruptions in the worſhip of God, and Miniſtery, though they knew them very well to be corruptions: and muſt all theſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their faith in Chriſt, needs bee damned, hauing leſſe knowledge in the ſame corruptions, becauſe they doe not ſeperate? Verily, thus to iudge of this latter ſort, liuing and dying in this eſtate, argueth not only want of charity, but beſides, great impiety. But tell me, I pray you, are none of theſe capable of true faith in Chriſt, becauſe of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the corruptions? Or if they be thereof capable, is it by their ignorance herein extinguiſhed? Nay, I would know of you, why they that haue knowledge and good vnderſtanding in the corruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and condemning them doe not ſeperate, may not as well be ſaued, as Maſter <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, Hooper,</hi> and <hi>Bradford:</hi> anſwere me this one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo I end:</p>

                  <hi>If Maſter</hi> Hooper, <hi>M.</hi> Bradford, <hi>with others, knowing the corruptions then in worſhip, and Miniſtery being theſame alſo with ours now, were, notwithſtanding this knowledge and not ſeperating, ſaued: then men at this day, notwithſtanding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18048:36"/> their knowledge of the corruptions, and not ſeperating becauſe of them, may likewiſe be ſaued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the firſt is true:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition muſt needs be true, conſidering that God is immutable: alſo no accepter of perſons. And the Aſſumption is true; as may be ſhewed by the parts thereof. He that ſhall reade the Acts of Monuments, may eaſily ſee that ſundry of the Martyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, had good knowledge and inſight into the corruptions wee ſpeake of. That the corruptions then in worſhip, Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and diſcipline, were the ſame with ours now, as many and great; their publike worſhip, alſo the very ſame wee performe to God now; and that notwithſtanding thoſe corruptions, and their knowledge of them, they did not ſeperat and withdraw themſelues from the publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, vntill ſuch time the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> that abominable Idoll, and groſſe Idolatry, crept into Gods worſhip; ſo as the body and ſubſtance of worſhip was defiled: That theſe things (I ſay) are true, no man can deny, but with ſhame enough. That they alſo were ſaued, you in effect acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in calling them Martyrs, and holy Martyrs, as before we haue heard, and your bookes euery where declare.</p>
               <p>Now that we haue been informed in the doctrine of the Church, and applied the ſame: ſeeing there are diuers gone out from among vs, whom wee call <hi>Browniſts,</hi> contrarie minded: who both reiect the aforeſaid doctrine, as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and condemne <hi>our Pariſh aſſemblies, for falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> it remaineth we heare what they likewiſe teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church; and their Arguments whereby they would proue <hi>our Church, to be a falſe Church:</hi> that ſo wee may more clearely ſee on which ſide the truth is: whereby the louers of the Truth, ſhall be preſerued from error, and Wiſdome iuſtified of her children.</p>

Barrow</hi> his book intituled, <hi>A true deſcription of the viſible Church:</hi> where hee ſaith, that <hi>into the viſible Church there entereth no vncleane thing or perſon,</hi> but all ſuch are without: how true this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, wee ſhall anon heare, as alſo of the <hi>gathering</hi> heere ſpoken of. And that the viſible Church, and conſequently all the members thereof, haue not Chriſt Ieſus to be their King, Prieſt, and Prophet; in the end of this booke it is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Omitting therefore theſe things, wee will come to that which in the deſcription followeth.</p>
               <p>In it you adde, that the viſible Church conſiſteth of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that <hi>worſhip Chriſt aright,</hi> and to proue this, you ſend vs to three places of Scripture, the two firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Exod. 20.7.8. Leuit. 10.5. ſpeake neuer a word for you. The laſt and onely teſtimony you haue, is Ioh. 4.23. where Ieſus ſaith, That <hi>the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and truth, and that the Father requireth ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> And hereof our Lord rendereth a reaſon, in the words next following, ſaying: <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and truth:</hi> which in effect is this: that God being of a ſpirituall nature, requireth a ſpirituall ſeruice agreeable to his nature. Of a company of ſuch kind of worſhippers (ſay you) doth the viſible Church conſiſt. But how can this poſſibly be true? ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus ſpeaking to ſome of the viſible Church,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.7.</note> ſaith thus, <hi>O Hypocrites,</hi> Eſaias <hi>prophecied well of you; ſaying: this people draweth neere vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is farre from mee: but in vaine doe they worſhip me.</hi> Theſe were no true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, worſhipping God <hi>in Spirit and truth,</hi> but only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Hypocritically, whereupon Ieſus calleth them <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> and yet were theſe worſhippers members of the viſible
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18048:37"/> Church. And whereas of the viſible Church the greateſt part are Hypocrites, or hypocriticall worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppers, by this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and doctrine of yours, there can be no Hipocrites in it: for you teach that the viſible Church is a company that worſhip God <hi>in Spirit and truth;</hi> but no Hypocrites worſhippe God <hi>in Spirit and truth:</hi> therefore (by your doctrine) no Hypocrites are of, or in the viſible Church. That no hypocrites doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God <hi>in ſpirit and truth,</hi> (which reſteth only to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) it is hereby manifeſt. Firſt, becauſe they doe not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God with a true and ſincere affection of the heart. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe this worſhipping of God <hi>in ſpirit and truth,</hi> is that worſhip which God requireth to be performed to him by men, accepteth of, and is well pleaſed with: but the worſhip of hypocrites God forbiddeth, reiecteth and abhorreth: Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites therefore doe not worſhip God <hi>in ſpirit and truth.</hi> Thirdly, As many as thus worſhip God in this world,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6. Pſal. 19.11.</note> he will honor in the world to come; and for their poore ſeruice done to him on earth, he will aboundantly reward them in heauen, now <hi>woe be to Hypocrites,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And againe, <hi>giue him his portion with Hypocrites.</hi> This is the hypocrites reward.</p>
               <p>Where you ſay, that the viſible Church is a company <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly gouerned by Chriſt's officers and lawes,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the greateſt part of the viſible Church are reprobates, and ſo rebels againſt Chriſt, taking part with Satan againſt him: how can this be truely ſaid of the viſible Church, and conſequently of all the members thereof? <hi>Cain, Iſmael, Eſau, Saul, Abſolom,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſies, were all of the viſible Church. Theſe and thouſands more ſuch in the Church, haue beene ſo farre from being quietly gouerned by Chriſts lawes, that with them in the ſecond Pſalme they haue ſaid:<note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Let vs breake their bonds, and caſt their cords from vs.</hi> The viſible Church therefore is not a company of ſuch loyall and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubiects to Chriſt, as theſe men affirme. How peaceably and quietly was <hi>Saul</hi> gouerned by the lawes of God and Church officers then, when he cauſed the Prieſts of the Lord to be ſlaine, and eagerly perſecuted <hi>Dauid,</hi> thirſting after his bloud, and that all his life time. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Cain,</hi> killing <hi>Abel,</hi> of <hi>Iſmael</hi> mocking, or (as the Apoſtle ſaith)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18048:38"/> perſecuting <hi>Iſaak:</hi> of <hi>Abſalom</hi> when he killed his brother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt his father, lay with his Concubines, and vſurped the Kingdome: of the Scribes and Phariſies traducing, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, mocking, and putting to death the Lord Ieſus: and laſtly, of all the domeſticall enemies of the Church, who haue reuiled, ſlandered, impriſoned, baniſhed, and murthered the Saints. All theſe were of the viſible Church, and yet were none of theſe <hi>peaceably gouerned by Chriſts officers and lawes,</hi> but were rebels againſt Chriſt, tranſgreſſors of his lawes, and deſpiſers of his officers. You ſpeake therefore moſt vntruely, when you ſay that the viſible Church is a company &amp; fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>peaceably &amp; quietly gouerned by Chriſt his officers &amp; laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, in requiring <hi>loue vnfained</hi> in all the members of the viſible Church, ſeeing this loue is an effect of faith vnfained, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, 1. Tim. 1.5. Doe you not therein alſo require of them that be of this ſociety, that faith which worketh by loue,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>euen the true and iuſtifying faith, the end whereof is the ſaluation of mans ſoule?</hi> Whereupon followeth that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church is a company of faithfull indeed, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch as ſhall be ſaued. This that I inſerre, how falſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, you feare not to teach, ſaying, <hi>They keepe the vnitie of faith in the bond of peace.</hi> This <hi>loue vnfained</hi> they onely haue which loue the brethren, not in word and tongue, but in deed and truth, as appeareth alſo by their quoting of Ioh. 13.34. But this loue whoſoeuer haue, are tranſlated from death to life, and thereof may aſſure themſelues: The whole company therefore of the viſible Church hauing this loue as you teach, are (by this doctrine) ſure of life and ſaluation. Doe you not bluſh to tell vs (in effect) that that loue is to be found in euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the viſible Church, which, the holy Ghoſt doth giue vs for an infallible marke of the child of God, and heire of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Another place of Scripture that in the margent is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the proofe hereof is 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.<hi>4.</hi> Can that loue (trow you) the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh of, fal into the reprobate, and be found in any but Gods elect, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly effects it hath, in whomſoeuer it is? Among other things of this loue it is ſaid, that <hi>it thinketh not euill it reioyceth not in iniquity, but reioceth in the truth,</hi> and that <hi>it doth neuer fall away.</hi> In which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18048:38"/> reſpect it doth excell faith and hope, as is ſaid in the laſt verſe, <hi>now abideth faith, hope, and loue, but the chiefeſt of theſe is loue,</hi> What meane you to require this loue, which is proper to the elect, in all the members of the viſible Church, of the which the moſt are reprobates? <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his brother, <hi>Iſmael</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Iſaak:</hi> of <hi>Eſau</hi> it is ſaid, That he <hi>hated Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cen. 27.41.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe of the bleſsing, wherewith his father had bleſſed him,</hi> and therefore purpoſed to <hi>ſlay</hi> him. How deadly <hi>Saul</hi> did hate <hi>Dauid,</hi> and hunt after his life, as one would hunt a Partridge, the holy ſtory maketh mention. And as for the Scribes and Phariſies, their extreame hatred againſt Chriſt, and all that confeſſed him, is manifeſt in the hiſtory of the Goſpell; their crucifying of Chriſt, and perſecuting of his members, did ſhew the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that was in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Hereunto we may adde, the perſecut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs and murtherers of the Saints that haue beene in the Church, almoſt in all ages, many whereof were of the viſible Church: yet were they ſo farre from <hi>louing the brethren,</hi> that they did hate them with a cruell hatred. We ſee then men haue bin of the viſible Church, and therefore may be at this day, who haue not this <hi>vnfained loue</hi> of the brethren: nay, are as far from it, as hatred from loue, and darkneſſe from light. How then doe you truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the viſible Church, that it is a company of men, who <hi>loue one another vnfainedly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in effect you teach, that the viſible Church conſiſteth of a company and fellowſhip of people, who as they are at peace with God, and among themſelues, ſo haue they <hi>vnf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>there is no peace, ſaith the Lord, to the wicked;</hi> ſo neither are they, nor can be at peace with men, I meane, the reſt of the Church, which are the elect: Except you will haue peace betweene the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and the woman, and both their ſeeds.

You ſay, nay, they are all tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>bond of peace and loue.</hi> Ieſus ſaith of himſelfe, That <hi>he came not to ſend peace into the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10.34. Luk. 12.49.51.</note> 
                  <hi>but</hi> rather <hi>debate and a ſword;</hi> nay, <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>what is his deſire, but that it be kindled.</hi> Is not this ſword and fire, the ſeperation alſo and enmity that our Lord further ſpeaketh of, which commeth through the preaching of the Goſpell, to be found in the Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the members thereof? But only betwixt them that are in the Church, and thoſe that are without? If any be thus fondly conceited, let him looke backe to the premiſſes, and his error will be corrected.</p>
               <p>As the aforeſaid members of the viſible Church, <hi>Iſmael, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, Saul,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſies, had not this <hi>loue vnfained,</hi> ſo neither had they, the other eſſentiall properties which you require in all them who be of a true viſible Church. They were not faithfull and holy indeed, nor yet holy in the face and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, which you require at leaſt; nor otherwiſe <hi>faithfull and holy,</hi> then the moſt open wicked of our Land: They had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>their King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Prieſt, and Prophet.</hi> They were rebels, and none of Chriſts ſubiects or people, all which he will ſaue. The Diuell was their father and king, and they his children and vaſſals, doing the luſts of him their father, in ſtead of the wil of God. As he was a murtherer from the beginning, ſo were they all murtherers in their times. The like may bee ſaid touching Chriſt his not being their Prieſt, nor Prophet. Worſhippers of God they were indeed, but hypocriticall, not true and ſincere worſhippers: of many of them Ieſus ſaid, <hi>Yee worſhip God in vaine;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 15.9.</note> not one of them <hi>worſhipped God aright,</hi> in ſpirit and truth: neyther did they liue <hi>after the lawes of God and Chriſt;</hi> but after the lawes and cuſtomes, and faſhion of this world, whereof they were. When men ſpake to them of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18048:39"/> 
                  <hi>peace,</hi> they were bent to warre; and in ſtead of <hi>loue vnfained,</hi> they did beare a perfect hatred to the Saints. Theſe men then were not ſuch as be heere deſcribed; yea, none of them had any one of theſe properties, which you neceſſarily require in euery member of the viſible Church, much leſſe all of them: And therefore by this deſcription, none of them were of the viſible Church: and yet by the Scripture it is plaine, that they were all of the viſible Church. Thus we ſee your deſcription accordeth not with the holy Scriptures, neither hath warrant from thence, but by them is eaſily conuinced: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you alledge for confirmation thereof ſixe and thirty teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of holy Scripture. But a thouſand more ſo peruerted, will not make good your deſcription, nor any other of your errors. And becauſe I know you will hardly leaue this hold, and for that if this be battered downe, and made euen with the ground, you muſt needs betake your ſelues ſome other way: I will therefore againe aſſault you by the force of another Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the viſible Church be a company of faithfull and holy people, that worſhip Chriſt aright, are peaceably and quietly gouerned by his officers and lawes, keepe the vnitie of faith in the bond of peace and loue vnfained: Then none haue been at any time of the viſible Church, but ſuch as haue beene faithfull and holy, did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt aright, &amp;c:</hi> as followeth in your deſcription:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſome haue beene of the viſible Church, who were not ſuch as be heere deſcribed, as</hi> Cain, Iſmael, Eſau, Saul, Doeg, Ioab, Abſalom, <hi>the Scribes and Phariſies, with infinite others:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the viſible Church is not a company of faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, worſhipping Chriſt aright,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence of the Propoſition, I doe illuſtrate and confirme by the like. If the viſible Church be a company of people profeſſing the true Religion, then none haue beene of the viſible Church, but ſuch as haue profeſſed the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If the inuiſible Church be the company of the elect then none haue beene or are of the inuiſible Church, but ſuch as were and are elect, and their names written in the booke of life.

Yet profeſſe they the true worſhip of God, and faith in Chriſt Ieſus; and in this reſpect may be called faithfull in Chriſt Ieſus, and Saints: becauſe whatſoeuer they be, their profeſſion is holy, and he holy, in whom they would ſeeme to belieue and whom they ſeeme to worſhip truly. And in this ſence, our Church ſaith, <hi>A viſible Church is a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of faithfull people,</hi> that is, of ſuch as profeſſe <hi>faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Of this ſort of Infidels and counterfeit Profeſſors, were <hi>Cain,</hi> and for a time <hi>Iſmael, Eſau,</hi> alſo <hi>Saul, Abſalom, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Simon Magus</hi> with infinite more.

And this you put downe in your deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thereby you might proue our Pariſh aſſemblies to bee no true, but falſe viſible Churches: becauſe in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, the people then liuing were not <hi>called by the Word,</hi> and <hi>gathered</hi> by the preaching thereof, but all brought in at once by her commandement, and proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:18048:41"/>
               <p>We anſwere, If we ſpeake of a Church when it is firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I meane of a Nation when firſt it commeth to embrace and profeſſe the Goſpell and true Religion, the people of ſuch a Nation for a great part there of are <hi>called by the word of God,</hi> before they come to be a viſible Church. By the power and truth of the Word, and diuine maieſtie ſhining euery where therein, the children of men be brought to forſake their falſe Religion and worſhip, and to ioyne together in the profeſſion of true Religion, whereby they become a viſible Church. And this is confirmed throughout the whole ſtory of the Acts of the Apoſtles, both in the conuerſion of the Iewes, or gathering viſible Churches of them, ſet downe in the nine firſt Chapters; and likewiſe of the gentiles: continuing from the beginning of the tenth Chapter to the latter end of that booke. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Acts, where mention is made of a great increaſe, or addition to the viſible Church, (that before that time was among the Iewes) of about three thouſand ſoules: and in the fourth of the Acts of a further increaſe to about fiue thouſand:<note place="margin">Act. 2.14. and 4.4.</note> in both theſe places the meanes is ſpecified, whereby this was brought to paſſe, and that is ſaid to be, <hi>the hearing and and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the word of God preached</hi> by <hi>Peter</hi> and other of the Apoſtles. In the eight chapter of the Actes, wee reade of a Church gathered in the Citie of Samaria by <hi>Philip</hi> his <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt vnto them:</hi> and in the eleuenth Chapter of the Acts, of a great Church gathered by the <hi>preaching of certaine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and Euangeliſts in Antiochia in Syria. In a word, where in the Acts we reade of the conuerſion of a people to God, as in Antiochia a Citie of Piſidia, in Iconium, Liſtra, Derbe, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, Theſſalonica, Berea, Athens, Corinthus and Rome, in the ſame places we heare that they were <hi>called,</hi> and the ſaid viſible Churches <hi>gathered</hi> by the preaching of the word. But mark, all theſe Churches were now firſt planted, and theſe people newly conuerted from Iudaiſme, or Gentiliſme, (that is, eyther from the Iewiſh Religion, or falſe Religion of the Gentiles) to the Chriſtian Religion.

                  </gap>ng of a Church, <hi>the preaching of the Word</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary, ſo as without it a company of people cannot bee brought to be a Church. But if we ſpeake of a Church eſtabliſhed, or of a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18048:42"/> Country, where for ſome time true Religion hath beene profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and God truly worſhipped, though ſometimes interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, broken off, and diſcontinued, which is our caſe, then this holdeth not. As vnder the Law both Iewes and Gentiles (profeſsing the Iewiſh religion) by Circumciſion, ſo by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Chriſtians vnder the Goſpell are incorporated into the viſible Church, and made members thereof. Are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithfull by Baptiſme receiued into the viſible Church; and thereby made members thereof? And not by <hi>the call of the word,</hi> the ſound whereof many of them do not heare, and if they doe they cannot vnderſtand it? And what letteth, why ſome of theſe when they bee growen men, may not thorough hypocriſie continue in the Church; though in the hardnes of their hearts they neuer were affected and touched with the word: many ſuch hypocrites and hard-hearted men, dead in their ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and that haue conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſeared with a hot Iron, haue euer beene, are, and ſhall be in the Church, who neuer by <hi>the call of the word,</hi> and power thereof, would haue become members of the Church, nor haue felt any touch that way, but onely becauſe they were borne and brought vp in the Church, and not caſt out: either through the want of due execution of diſcipline, or elſe through their deepe diſſimulation and hypocriſie, they being like painted tombes, which appeare beautifull outward, but are within full of dead mens bones, and all filthineſſe. Surely, it is not to be thought, that <hi>Cain, Iſmael, Eſau,</hi> with others; that many of the fatte Bulls of Baſan, that many of thoſe who in Iſrael killed the Prophets, and ſtoned them which were ſent vnto them; that many of the Scribes and Phariſies were affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Word, or ſo much as taſted of the power and ſweetnes thereof, and yet were they all of the viſible Church. How were theſe then <hi>called by the word of God?</hi> Againe, that without this <hi>call by the word,</hi> men may come to be of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, it is yet more euident by the ſcripture. In the twelfth chapter of Exodus, where mention is made of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt; it is ſaid, That <hi>a great multitude of ſundry ſorts of all people went out with them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe. 38.</note> now all or moſt of theſe, we may aſſure our ſelues, were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18048:42"/> &amp; of the Iewes Religion, &amp; ſo of the viſible Church; and yet vndoubtedly they came not to be ſuch by the <hi>call of the word;</hi> or by the power and operation therof: but by beholding the great and wonderfull workes which the Lord wrought by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the freedom of the Iewes from thoſe plagues which fell vpon the Egyptians. When <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was hanged, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> exalted, and comfortable letters ſent to the Iewes, that they ſhould be readie on ſuch a day, and auenge themſelues on their enemies: ſo as vnto the Iewes was come light, and ioy, and gladneſſe, and honor, it is recorded in that ſtory,<note place="margin">Eſter 8.17.</note> that <hi>many of the people of that Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Iewes,</hi> that is, turned to, and profeſſed the Iewes Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo were ioyned to the Church: and then immediatly is ſhewed how that came to paſſe: not by the <hi>call,</hi> power, and operation <hi>of the Word,</hi> but becauſe <hi>the feare of the Iewes fell vpon them.</hi> This is manifeſt, likewiſe in the Goſpell, where many are ſaid <hi>to beleeue in Chriſt,</hi> that is, to profeſſe faith in Chriſt, and ſo were of the viſible Church, of whom it is plaine, they were not drawne thereunto by the word, but ſome by the report they heard of Chriſt, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.39. ſome for their belly ſake to be fed by him, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.26. and ſome by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. Seeing then this is not neceſſarie, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally true of all the members of the Church, that they are <hi>called by the word of God,</hi> very vnfitly was it placed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a viſible Church: which if it were good, would be true, and each part of it, of euery member thereof: If it bee true that a viſible Church is a company of men, then thus is it alſo true: whoſoeuer is not a man, is not, nor can be of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church; and therefore no Angels, no ſpirits or ſoules of men can be of this Church; euen ſo it is in this caſe. If this be true, that a viſible Church is a company <hi>called by the word of God,</hi> then this is true alſo, that whoſoeuer is not called by the word, and hath not felt the force and power of this mighty word, is no member of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, ſuppoſe that one of the viſible Church haue children and ſeruants that be Papiſts, and that he, after other perſwaſions, commands and threats, ſhall ſay vnto them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee forſake your idolatry, and worſhip God according to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18048:43"/> his word, and not after the traditions and deuiſes of men, yee ſhall be no children, nor ſeruants vnto mee. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they frequent the Church aſſemblies, and in proceſſe of time doe in policie outwardly ſeeme to be religious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Popery, and p ofeſsing the true Religion, when in the meane ſeaſon they continue Popiſh ſtill. And not thoſe to be accounted of the viſible Church? Yes verily, for what though they haue a heart, and a heart: that is nothing to man: we muſt leaue that to God. Yet theſe children and ſeruants came not to bee of the Church by the <hi>call of the Word.</hi> And herein this Father and Maſter did nothing but what in duety to God,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> and loue to men, he ought to doe. <hi>For I know him, ſaith the Lord, that he will command his ſonnes, and his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, to doe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and iudgement, that the Lord may bring vpon</hi> Abraham <hi>that he hath ſpoken vnto him.</hi> May and ought the Maſter and Father of a family doe this, and may not or ought not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Country according to that authority which God hath giuen him likewiſe do the like by his family?

You ought rather to haue commended her for it. When <hi>Iudah</hi> was fallen to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, whereby it became a falſe Church, the Lord raiſed vp certaine Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> to reſtore and purge the Religion and worſhip of God, then greatly corrupted, whereby it became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine a true Church.

               <p>Obſerue this mans euaſion, and what ſhift he makes to help himſelfe in a ſtrait. They will ſeeme to anſwere, when they do nothing leſſe. For the iuſtifying of this, That <hi>Chriſtian Princes may and ought to command their ſubiects, being Idolaters, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Idolatry, and worſhip the Lord, and conſequently to ioyne themſelues to the true Church.</hi> Wee alleage the examples and practiſe of certaine Kings of Iudah, and namely of <hi>Aſa, Hezekiah, Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> who did the like. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the firſt of theſe examples, you tell vs, that howſoeuer the Religion and worſhip of God was corrupted in <hi>Abijah</hi> his time, the predeceſſor of <hi>Aſa,</hi> yet was it true Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was then maintained, and a true Church which <hi>Aſa</hi> found when he came to the Kingdome: but ſuch was not our eſtate and condition, when King <hi>Edward</hi> and Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> entred vpon their Kingdomes: The caſe therefore is not alike. But we deſire you to proue, That in the dayes of <hi>Abijah</hi> Iudah was a true Church, and that <hi>Abijah</hi> maintained Gods true Religion, and worſhip. I confeſſe that in Iudah God had a Church &amp; people in <hi>Abijah</hi> his raigne, who were of the true Religion, and worſhipped him truely, yea, I adde, that at this time in Iſrael, vnder <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the Lord had his Church, and people that were of the true Religion and worſhip, as is plaine by 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.13, 14, 16. But I deny that Iudah was then a true Church, and that <hi>Abijah</hi> maintained Gods true Religion and worſhip; and affirme that Iudah was now Idolatrous, as well as Iſrael, whom your ſelfe calls (and that truely) <hi>idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Iſrael:</hi> though both theſe Kingdoms were not idolatrous
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18048:44"/> in like degree. That this is ſo, it is plaine by the holy Story of theſe Kings and times. For marke what <hi>Aſa Abijah</hi> his ſonne and ſucceſſor, is ſaid to doe vpon his entrance into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>He tooke away the altars of the ſtrange gods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chron. 14.3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and the high places, and brake downe the Images, and cut downe the groues:</hi> Heere is mention of <hi>the altars of ſtrange gods,</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> to wit, of falſe gods, of <hi>the high places,</hi> where they offered to theſe gods, and of <hi>the groues,</hi> which were dedicated vnto them, which <hi>Aſa,</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Abijah,</hi> forthwith deſtroyed. Doe not theſe things euidently declare, that in the raigne of <hi>Abijah</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry was ſet vp, and maintained in Iudah, and therefore A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIIAH <hi>maintained not Gods true Religion, and worſhip?</hi> If you obiect that theſe <hi>Altars, Images,</hi> and <hi>High places,</hi> were not erected and ſet vp by <hi>Abijah,</hi> but by <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his father, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through want of zeale he let them alone, and did not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them, and that this only was his ſinne, and the ſinne of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah: I anſwere, the contrary is manifeſt, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.12. where thus we reade: <hi>And</hi> Aſa <hi>tooke away the Sodomites out of the Land, and put away all the Idols that his Fathers had made.</hi> By Fathers, here muſt needs be vnderſtood <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Abijah.</hi> If further you obiect, that howſoeuer <hi>Abijah</hi> was an Idolater, yet the Kingdome was not fallen to idolatry, but the people generally worſhipped God truly: I anſwere, this cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be true, for euermore it went thus with the Iewes, like Prince, like People. If the King were religious, then the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and State embraced and profeſſed true Religion, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and if the King was an Idolater, and falſe worſhipper, then generally the people were ſuch. Beſides, this obiection is anſwered and conuinced, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. And heere I reaſon thus with you:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That King and people which ſet vp and maintaine the worſhip of a falſe god, or gods, is a falſe Church:</p>

                  <p>Therefore <hi>Abijah</hi> and his people, were a falſe Church.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Propoſition none will gain-ſay; and the Aſſumption is proued by the aforeſaid teſtimonie of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Againe, that ABIIAH <hi>did not maintaine Gods true Religion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18048:45"/> and worſhip,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Iudah</hi> in his dayes was not a true Church, it is confirmed by the fourth verſe of the former Scripture:<note place="margin">2. Chron. 14, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>And</hi> Aſa <hi>tooke away the altars of the ſtrange gods,</hi> &amp;c as is aforeſaid, <hi>and commanded Iudah to ſeeke the Lord God of their Fathers, and to doe according to the Law, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</hi> In that Iudah is heere commanded by <hi>Aſa</hi> to worſhip the Lord <hi>according to the Law and Commandement</hi> of God, giuen in that behalfe, for this is the meaning of the words: thereby is inſinuated that before, and in <hi>Abijah</hi> his time, they did not worſhip God after his Law and Commandement but otherwiſe, euen after their owne inuentions, which is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and falſe worſhip. Laſtly, I reaſon againſt you thus: Iudah was an idolatrous and falſe Church in <hi>Rehoboams</hi> time: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Abijah</hi> his daies. The Antecedent I proue by 1. <hi>King.</hi> 14.22, 23, 24. compared with 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.3, 4. and 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.3. alſo by 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. <hi>And when</hi> Rehoboam <hi>had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Kingdome, and made it ſtrong, he forſooke the Law of the Lord,</hi> (that is, to worſhip the Lord according to his Law, which is true worſhip) <hi>and all Iſrael,</hi> meaning all Iudah, <hi>with him.</hi> The conſequence is corfirmed, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.3. <hi>And</hi> Abijah <hi>walked in all the ſinnes of his Father, which hee had done before him:</hi> but his Father ſet vp, and maintained a falſe Religion and falſe worſhip: Therefore the ſonne.</p>
               <p>You tell vs that ABIIAH <hi>maintained Gods true Religion, and worſhip, againſt idolatrous Iſrael, both by word and ſword.</hi> How can this poſſibly be true, ſeeing <hi>Abijah</hi> maintained in Iudah a falſe Religion and worſhip, as well as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and was an Idolater, as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was. Suppoſe there were now warre betweene the King of Spaine, and the Pope, about ſome Ciuill matter; ſome Territories, or other commoditie, that each of them make claime to. If becauſe of this I ſhould affirme, that the King of Spaine maintaineth Gods true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and worſhip, againſt idolatrous Rome: would not you and all men laugh at me for my folly and falſitie? No leſſe ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and falſe is that you affirme of <hi>Abijah.</hi> True it is that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bijah</hi> had warre with <hi>Ieroboam</hi> King of Iſrael, but <hi>Religion</hi> was not the cauſe thereof, but this. <hi>Abijah</hi> being valiant, would haue brought backe againe the Kingdome of Iſrael, which <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:18048:45"/> had taken (as <hi>Abijah</hi> ſaid to the whole armie of Iſrael) by rebellion, from his father REHOBOAM <hi>a childe, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted and one that could not reſiſt him,</hi> as <hi>Abijah</hi> ſaith of him. <hi>Abijah</hi> his loue then and deſire after the Kingdome of Iſrael, was the cauſe of this warre, as is plaine by 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.5, 6, 7. and not his zeale for <hi>the true Religion,</hi> and hatred of the falſe, as your words pretend. A man that readeth theſe words of yours, would likewiſe imagine that <hi>Abijah</hi> was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and worſhipped God truly: whereas in truth he was a notorious hypocrite, and groſſe idolater. In the ſhutting vp of your anſwere touching <hi>Aſa,</hi> you ſay that ASA <hi>found not his Kingdome a falſe Church, as King</hi> Edward <hi>and Queene</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth <hi>found England.</hi> This alſo is very vntrue. Nay, ASA found Iudah worſe, then they did England. For Iudah in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bijah</hi> his raigne worſhipped falſe gods: whereas England in the daies of King <hi>Henry</hi> and Queene <hi>Mary</hi> worſhipped the true God, though after a falſe manner.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that Iudah in <hi>Abijah</hi> his time, was not a falſe Church, and that <hi>Aſa</hi> found it a true: that lets not, but that in Iudah there might be idolaters at the ſame time, worſhipping either a falſe God, or the true God after a falſe manner, as the Papiſts at this day in England doe. Nay, wee cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſuch there were indeed, conſidering this is ſaid of <hi>Aſa</hi> in the very entrance into his Kingdome,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 14.3.</note> 
                  <hi>That hee tooke away the altars of the ſtrange gods and the high places, and brake downe the Images, and cut downe the groues.</hi> Verſ. 4. <hi>And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Iudah to ſeeke the Lord God of their Fathers, and to doe according to the Law and the Commandement.</hi> Now theſe ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters that in their <hi>high places offered to ſtrange gods,</hi> did ASA <hi>command</hi> to forſake their idolatrie, and to worſhip the Lord God of their Fathers, after the manner hee had commanded: as is plaine. Firſt, By the coherence and dependance of the two verſes aforeſaid. Secondly, ASA, needed not to giue this commandement to them, who did already worſhip God true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but to the idolaters that were in Iudah, that eyther wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped ſtrange gods, or the Lord after their owne inuentions, and not as he had commanded. Is it not then plaine in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Aſa,</hi> That <hi>Chriſtian Princes may and ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18048:46"/> their ſubiects being idolaters, to forſake their idolatrie, and to worſhip the Lord,</hi> and conſequently, to ioyne themſelues to the true Church: ſay it were true, that the Church of Iudah was then not a falſe, but a true Church? Yes verily, euen al one, as if the Church in <hi>Abijah</hi> his time, had been a falſe Church, as indeed it was. Specially if hereunto we adde that which is ſet downe in the ſecond verſe: <hi>That herein</hi> Aſa <hi>did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> But grant we that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude you ſpeake of, would helpe you againſt the example and practiſe of <hi>Aſa:</hi> yet is it no anſwere to the other two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> ſeeing they found the Church of Iudah euery whit as falſe a Church, as King <hi>Edward</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did the Church of England. Yea, falſe in a higher degree, worſhipping falſe Gods, whereas England in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight,<note place="margin">Nay England enioyed the true worſhip of God, part of King Henry his raigne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Queene Anne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſixe bloudie arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

And this appeareth by your owne words, for you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that IOSIAH <hi>purged his Land of falſe worſhip.</hi> 2. <hi>That he reduced his people vnto the true ſeruice of God:</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ioſiah</hi> his raigne in <hi>Amon</hi> his daies, they had the falſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and worſhip of God eſtabliſhed among them.

But the former of theſe is true, by your owne confeſſion: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter.

So as out of the aſhes of the Martyres there did ſpring a multitude of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, beſides the faithfull that were in the land before. Whereof ſome hauing fled beyond the Seas, did now returne home with ioy: others hauing hid themſelues, as it were in caues, and holes came forth. Theſe were ſcattered throughout the land, and it is to be thought there were many thouſands of them which neuer bowed the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> And theſe mixed with others who came vnto them, and ioyned with them in one and the ſame profeſſion, made true viſible Churches. Whereby we ſee that albeit many receiued the Goſpell for the Commandements ſake: yet not all. Some there were that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered and thirſted for the Goſpell before it came, and groned vnder the preſent ſuperſtitious and idolatrous worſhip: ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crying vnto God day and night becauſe of it, &amp; they not a few. And tell me I pray you; had they not in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> the word of God read in their mother tongue in euery Congregation throughout the land? and preached alſo heere and there, according to the number of Preachers then? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they had the holy Bible in the Engliſh tongue in their houſes: wherein no doubt many did meditate day and night. Alſo many godly Bookes, ſpecially againſt papiſtrie were, in their hands: whereof they were daily ſcattering and reading all the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary.</hi> In her time alſo many in the land had their ſecrete meetings, ſometimes by day, ſometimes by night, wherin they ioyned together in the word and prayer, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments. Tidings and letters went daily on euery ſide, concerning the patience and alacritie of the Martyrs in their ſufferings; their conſtantie, their graue and learned anſweres and Apologies: and of the rude and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned replies, the ſauage and cruell dealing of the Prelates with them on the other ſide.

But concerning the viſible Church this <hi>calling by the Word,</hi> is not neceſſarie, ſo that without it we cannot come to be of this fellowſhip. Which we cannot chuſe but ſee, if we call to minde that which we haue beene taught: That <hi>a viſible Church
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18048:54"/> is a company profeſsing true religion.</hi> To ioyne in which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſsion (whereby we become members of the viſible Church) one may be drawne by the commandement &amp; threat, counſell and perſwaſion of man, the Word of God neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neare his heart. And ſo I leaue the firſt part of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and proceede to examine that which therein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A viſible Church,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is a company of people, ſeperated from the world.</hi> This doe we alſo hold and teach, rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that is, touching their profesſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true religion: and ſo are we ſeperated from Heathens, Infidels, Turkes, Papiſts, Anabaptiſts &amp;c. But thus you vnderſtand not theſe words: you meane hereby that a viſible Church is a company of faithfull and righteous men onely, or Saints, not mixed with, but <hi>ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the open wicked of the world.</hi> That this is your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is plaine by your owne Treatiſes, as forthwith we ſhall heare: and namely where you ſay,<note place="margin">Defence of the Churches and Miniſters of England. 71.</note> that <hi>a viſible Church is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated company of Righteous men from the open wicked of the world, and cannot conſiſt of all ſorts of people, good and bad.</hi> And for the proofe of this point, and part of your deſcription, you ſend vs to <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.14. <hi>I haue giuen them thy word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apologie 44. Marke here their peruert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the end of this Section, and the three next following.</note> 
                  <hi>and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</hi> Whoſoeuer ſhall aduiſedly reade this Chapter may eaſily ſee, that theſe words are meant of the eleuen Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, being parcell of that part of Chriſts prayer hee made for them in particular. That Ieſus ſpeaketh here of his elect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles it is manifeſt both by the words going before this 14. <hi>verſe,</hi> and ſpecially by <hi>verſe</hi> 12. as alſo by the <hi>verſes</hi> following after, and namely by <hi>verſe</hi> 18. and 20. what is this at all then to purpoſe? Surely no more for the proofe of the point, then if you had produced the firſt words of <hi>Geneſ. In the beginning God created the heauen and the earth.</hi> Frame your Argument, and the vanitie of your proofe will appeare. If that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles members of viſible Churches were ſeparated from the world, then all the members of a viſible Church muſt bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the world. But the firſt is true: Therefore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. To this effect you muſt marke your Argument, or none at all. Giue mee leaue now to argue after the ſame manner. If
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18048:55"/> the Apoſtles members of viſible Churches, were preachers of the word, and had the gift of miracles: then euery member of the viſible Church muſt be a preacher of the word, and haue the gift of miracles: But the firſt is true: therefore the ſecond. Thus could I proue that the members of viſible Churches muſt haue no certaine abiding place, but goe from place to place, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom one countrey to another throughout the world, for the Apoſtles did ſo. Therefore in vaine is this teſtimonie alled<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed by you, and you therein take Gods name in vaine. I doe not deny but that many things ſpoken of or to the Apoſtles, or required to be in them, are likewiſe required, and happily found in euery member of the viſible Church. The Apoſtle prayed, and heard the word: ſo it may bee doe all the members of the viſible Church. Some of the Apoſtles Ieſus commanded that they ſhould faſt and pray, leſt they did enter into temptation: the ſame he requireth of all in the Church. But this is it I ſay and meane. That it followeth not neceſſarily, that becauſe this or that qualitie or gift was or ought to be in the Apoſtles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is and ought to bee in euery member of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>But happily you will not vnderſtand this ſcripture of the eleuen Apoſtles, but extend it further. Seeing by the Text it is euident that Chriſt ſpake and meant it onely of them, without falſifying the Text, you cannot ſtretch it an haire breadth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But ſuppoſe the words might be vnderſtood more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the vtmoſt extent muſt be to the Elect. Firſt, becauſe Ieſus ſpeaketh of them for whom he prayed: and theſe be onely the Elect. Secondly hee ſpeaketh of thoſe which are hated of the world, and of ſuch as being in the world, are <hi>not of the world:</hi> and ſuch alone bee the Elect. Now this maketh not at all for you, no more then the former. For what though the Elect which are in the viſible Church be <hi>ſeparated from the world,</hi> (which is true as Chriſt here meaneth) doth it therevpon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all in the viſible Church are ſeparated from the world? Iudge your ſelues. So one may proue that all of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church ſhall be ſaued, becauſe the Elect which be in the viſible Church are heyres of Saluation.</p>
               <p>Another fault which in alleadging this Scripture you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18048:55"/> is this, that you miſ-vnderſtand theſe words of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>are not of the world:</hi> whereby he meaneth, not <hi>ſeparated from the world,</hi> in your ſence, that is, <hi>from the open wicked in the world:</hi> but that his Apoſtles were not worldly indeede, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the things of the world: or, that they were ſuch as would not conforme and faſhion themſelues to the manners and cuſtomes of this world; would not follow this world (as worldly minded men doe) in that which is euill, therefore the world ſhould hate them. With this ſpeech of Chriſt, agreeth that of <hi>Peter: It ſeemeth to them ſtrange,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye runne not with them to the ſame exceſſe of ryot: therefore ſpeake they euill of you.</hi> Suppoſe then that Ieſus did not ſpeake here onely of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nor yet ſolely of the Elect, but that his ſpeech was more generall, and reached euent to the viſible Church: yet would not this teſtimonie proue that for which it is by you produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to wit, that <hi>a viſible Church is a company, not mixed with, but ſeparated from the open wicked of the world:</hi> Much leſſe then vnderſtanding this Scripture aright, and as is before expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Thus is to ſet the holy Scriptures not on the tenters, which is euill; but on the racke, which is farre worſe.</p>
               <p>No leſſe faultie are you in alledging to this purpoſe the 20. <hi>verſe</hi> of this ſaid 17. Chapter: <hi>I pray not for theſe alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for them which ſhall beleeue in me through their word.</hi> Where Ieſus ſpeaketh of, and prayeth for the Elect onely and inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church militant, and not for the viſible Church. But grant it were ſpoken and meant of the Church viſible, yet would it not ſerue to proue that for which it is by you alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

               <p>Moreouer, for the conformation of the aforeſaid doctrine,

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 21.23.</note> who when the ſeruants of the owner of the Vineyard were ſent to receiue the fruits thereof, <hi>tooke them and beate one, and killed another, and ſtoned another.

                  <hi>that marrying his ſon made a great feaſt,</hi> is ſingular to this purpoſe. Where firſt we muſt know that as by the Invitors, or the <hi>ſeruants</hi> that <hi>the King ſent forth to bid certaine to the wedding,</hi> we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Miniſters of the Word, ſo by the gheſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe that were inuited, the viſible Church and the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The former of theſe will not bee denyed by any: the later is confirmed by the 8. <hi>verſe.</hi> For as there by thoſe which were <hi>bidden to the marriage,</hi> are meant the viſible Church of the Iewes: ſo by gheſts after mentioned; <hi>verſe</hi> 9.10. and 11. are meant the viſible Church or Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the members thereof. Now what is ſaid of theſe gheſts? Firſt, that being bidden to this wedding, (that is, being called vpon by the Miniſters to be ſaued, and to partake with Chriſt (who is the Kings ſonne that is married) in the ioyes of the Kingdome of heauen, <hi>they would not come.

Thirdly, of parte of theſe gheſts, meaning the cheife of them, in regard of outward things, it is ſaid, that <hi>they tooke the Kings ſervants, and intreated them ſharply, and ſlew them.</hi> You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny that theſe were prophane &amp; godles. Prophane men therefore and notorious for their impiety, may be of the true viſible Church, and that a true viſible Church, wherein ſuch are, and remaine. Neither can you truely ſay, that there be worſe in our Church, if any ſo bad. The wickednes then of ſome in our Church, letteth it not for being a true Church. Herevnto may be added,<note place="margin">Verſe 9.10.</note> that this King commandeth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to bid to the mariage, <hi>all that ever they found both good and bad,</hi> which alſo they did accordingly.

And this is the ſcope and drift of the aforeſaid Parable, as is playne by the inference that he maketh thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe words next following the ſaid Parable: <hi>for many are called, but few choſen.</hi> Wherein <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſheweth how this commeth to paſſe which before he hath taught in the Parable, to wit, that in the viſible Church there are ſo many wicked, and ſo few good: ſo many prophaine &amp; earthly minded men, and ſo few that doe earneſtly deſire and ſeeke after heaven, and thoſe things that lead therevnto, and namely faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.

Yea the aforeſaid cauſe and reaſon of our Sauiour conſidered, how can it poſſibly be otherwiſe?

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. I anſwere you that theſe words of Chriſt cannot poſſibly be vnderſtood properly, and therefore you are much to blame that vrge the letter, ſeeing the ſence of the Scriptures, is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>The field is the world.</hi> So then it is as if Ieſus had ſaid: The field whereof I ſpeake in the Parable ſignifieth the world, or is like the world; is an image of the world.

               <p>I anſwere that this reaſon prooues as well the Church to be meant by the fielde, as the world: for as much in the Church, beſides the righteous &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the kingdom are hipocrites the children of the wicked: But that is compared to the fielde wherein ſuch are: <hi>Ergo,</hi> (by your owne argument) the church is compared to the fielde.

                  <hi>Whereupon</hi> (meaning if the viſible Church be the field, and the tares ſcandalous offenders) <hi>it muſt followe,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that as the Lord forbids the ſeruants to meddle with the tares, or with the plucking them vp, but will haue them and the wheate to growe together in the fielde till the harueſt: ſo Miniſters and people are ſtraightly inhibited and forbidden any way to admoniſh and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wicked and ſcandalous perſons in the Church, but muſt let them there remaine without diſturbance till the laſt iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. Some of the learned Diuines which you thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe haue preuented this obiection, and told you, that to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and reaſon from this Scripture as you doe, is to abuſe

For Chriſt in this parable (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his expoſion of it) aymeth at no other thing, then to comfort the godly againſt the grieuances which they haue by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing with hypocrites: in the meane while he would haue nothing miniſhed from the diſcipline of the Church: as which he himſelfe inſtituted after,</hi> Chap. 18.17. <hi>By the like reaſon the vſe of the ſword ſhould bee taken from the Magiſtrate: which God would haue to be vſed, as</hi> Paul <hi>teſtifieth,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>This parable then is not to be extended further then the ſcope thereof requireth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwere you: Ieſus heere ſpeaketh of a perfect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration betweene the wheate and tares, that is, the godly, and vngodly: ſuch as ſhall leaue no tares, not a tare (I ſay) among the whea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. For he ſpeaketh of ſuch a ſeperation as cannot be made without daunger to the wheate: for which cauſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, as verſ. 29. Secondly, of that ſeperation which ſhall bee made by the Angels, in the end of the world, verſ. 30.41. Now this letteth not, nor forbiddeth a ſeperation in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betwixt the cleane, and thoſe be apparently vncleane, the holy and prophane, the godly and notorious offenders, which may be ſeperated and taken away from the godly, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daunger to them at all.</p>
               <p>This reaſon likes you ſo well,<note place="margin">Iuſtif. 120.</note> that you vrge it the ſecond time, and thereunto adde two reaſons more. <hi>And that the Lord Ieſus</hi> (ſay you) <hi>no way ſpeakes of the tolleration of prophane perſons in the Church, it doeth appeare by theſe reaſons. Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> (as hath beene obſerued) <hi>he doeth not contradict himſelfe by forbidding the vſe of the keyes in one place, which in another he hath turned vpon impenitent offenders.</hi> Matth. 18.15.16.17. 2. <hi>In the excommunication of ſinners apparently obſtinate, with due circumſpection, and in the ſpirit of wiſdome, meekeneſſe, and long ſuffering, with ſuch other generall Chriſtian vertues, as with which all our ſpirituall ſacrifices ought to be ſeaſoned what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can there bee of any ſuch diſorder, as the plucking vp of the wheate with the tares, which the husbandman feareth,</hi> verſ. 29.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18048:68"/> 
                  <hi>Laſtly, the Lord Ieſus ſpeakes of the vtter ruinating and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the tares, the gathering and plucking them vp by the rootes,</hi> verſ. 28.29. <hi>And to this end they are reſerued by the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,</hi> verſ. 30. <hi>(euer preſuppoſed, they ſo continued) but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication rightly adminiſtred, is not for the ruine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any, but for the ſaluation of the partie thereby humbled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your firſt reaſon (in effect) is this.</p>
               <p>If Ieſus ſpeake heere of the tolleration of prophane perſons in the Church, then heere he forbids the weeding out, or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of them, whom in another place, <hi>vz. Matth.</hi> 18.15. Hee commands to be weeded out, or cenſured:</p>
               <p>But Ieſus doeth not contradict himſelfe:</p>
               <p>Therefore Ieſus ſpeaketh not here of the tolleration of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons.</p>
               <p>This reaſon being the very ſame with the former, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued anſwere. The ſecond argument is this.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſpeaketh of, and forbiddeth ſuch a ſeperation, as wherein there is danger of plucking vp the wheate with the tares.</p>
               <p>But in the excommunication of ſinners apparantly obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or ſeperating ſuch from the Church, there is no danger of plucking vp the wheate with the tares:</p>
               <p>Therefore of the excommunication of ſinners apparantly obſtinate, or ſeperating ſuch from the Church Chriſt ſpeaketh not, nor forbiddeth.</p>
               <p>Your third argument followeth.</p>
               <p>Ieſus ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aketh of the vtter ruinating and deſtruction of the tares.</p>
               <p>But excommunication (rightly adminiſtred) is not for the ruinating and deſtruction of any.</p>
               <p>Therefore of excommunication Ieſus doeth not ſpeake.</p>
               <p>We now ſee clearely that theſe two lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er arguments doe conclude and proue the ſame thing. But what? not that which your firſt argument doeth, as you pretend, and beare the ſilly reader in hand, but in ſtead thereof this, that <hi>in the parable of the tares, Chriſt ſpeakes not of excommunication or cenſures of the Church:</hi> which we not onely confeſſe, but teach and vrge
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18048:68"/> againſt you. But ſuppoſe, they did ſoundly prooue that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for which the are produced: to wit, that <hi>in the parable of the tares, Ieſus doeth not ſpeake of the tolleration of prophane perſons in the Church:</hi> yet did they not at all make againſt vs, for by prophane perſons you meane, 1. Scandalous offenders, or open wicked, 2. Such onely, deny eyther of theſe if you will. And ſo by your owne propoſition (which forſooth you will prooue by three arguments) you imply that we teach, that <hi>by tares are meant ſcandalous offenders, or knowne wicked onely.</hi> The contrary whereunto is manifeſt by the premiſes. You commit then here two foule faults beſides the former. One is, you perſue your owne ſhadowe, in ſtead of an aduerſary, 2. You abuſe the reader in making him beleeue wee hold that we doe not.</p>
               <p>But to proceede, ſay you: <hi>It may be ſome will anſwere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iuſtif. 117.</note> 
                  <hi>that Chriſt doeth not heere forbid his Diſciples the vſe of the cenſures againſt the wicked, but rather acquaints them before hand what will be the ſtate of the Church, and how the wicked will be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to continue in it vncenſured.</hi> This is indeede our anſwere, and I will maintaine it againſt all gaineſayers. You adde: <hi>and if this were ſo, it made nothing againſt me, nor for Maiſter Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi> No, Maiſter <hi>Robinſon.</hi> If there will bee and continue wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the Church vncenſured, if this will be the eſtate of the viſible Church by the teſtimonie of Chriſt Ieſus, then for as much as all that be and continue in the viſible church, are of it, euen members of it: it muſt needes be that the viſible Church is a mixt company, conſiſting of good and bad, godly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18048:71"/> by <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Sonne of man I haue made thee a watchman vnto the houſe of Iſrael, therefore heare the word at my mouth and giue them warning from me.</hi> Obſerue here the repugnance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie betweene the Prophet and the doctrine of theſe Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke: The Prophet telleth vs of three ſorts of men in the Church of open wicked, of righteous or godly in ſhew onely or appearance, and of ſuch as are indeede godly, euen the ſame they ſeeme and profeſſe to be. M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and his fellowes ſay no; The two laſt ſorts of men onely are in the Church, the firſt <hi>be neither of the Church, nor in the ſame.</hi> Chuſe now Reader to whether of theſe thou wilt giue eare.</p>
               <p>But they vvill ſay; wee acknowledge that there euer haue been, are, and will be hypocrites in the Church mixed with the godly, and ſuch were the wicked mentioned before that vvere in the Church of the Iewes. <hi>Cain</hi> offered ſacrifice as well as <hi>Habel.</hi> The ſame is ſaid of <hi>Saul:</hi> Alſo, <hi>that he worſhipped the Lord:</hi> ſo likewiſe did <hi>Doeg, Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> vvere circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and had the ſigne and ſeale of the righteouſnes of faith in and vpon their fleſh. And that the Scribes and Phariſes vvere hypocrites; it is euident by the teſtimonie of our Sauiour: <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.1.7. and by that ſpeech of his ſo often repeated. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Woe be to you Scribes and Phariſes Hypocrites:</hi> But the moſt of your aſſemblies be <hi>open and knowne wicked men:</hi> ſome of them being knowne to be ſwearers, others to be Prophaners of the Sabbath, Drunkards, Theeues, Whoremongers, couetous, and malicious perſons &amp;c. and cannot therefore bee accounted <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</hi> And your ſelfe doe confeſſe that in the Church there are theſe two ſorts of men onely, hypocrites or hypocriticall profeſſors, and ſincere worſhippers.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, you well vnderſtand not who be <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and doe wholly miſtake the matter in ſuppoſing that <hi>open wicked men</hi> cannot be reputed ſuch, whereas the <hi>open wicked,</hi> nay moſt vile and abominable men; notoriouſly alſo knowne to be ſuch; <hi>profeſsing true religion, be hypocrites.

               <p>Thus we ſee that very vvicked and vile men; and notoriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly knowne to be ſuch haue been and may be hypocrites: And therefore the open ſcandalous wicked in our aſſemblies may be and indeede are all of them hypocrites: Our aſſemblies being mixt companies, of Saints indeede, and hypocrites: and ſuch a company hath euermore the true viſible Church been. It is a fancy and vaine imagination of yours, that the vvicked in our aſſemblies are not hypocrites, and ſo to be accompted, becauſe their wickedneſſe is not ſecret, but manifeſt and to be ſeene of all men. Whereas, all that profeſſe Chriſtianitie, and liue not the liues of Chriſtians; are hypocrites: But ſuch bee the open and ſecret wicked in our publike aſſemblies: Therefore as well the open as the ſecret wicked in our publike aſſemblies are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. In <hi>Math.</hi> 15. our Lord vſeth theſe words to the Scribes and Phariſes: O hypocrites: Eſaias <hi>prophecied well of you; ſaying, This people draweth neere vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is farre of from me: But in vaine they worſhip me.</hi> Hence wee learne, that all they vvhich draw neere vnto God vvith their mouths, and honour him vvith their lips, hauing their hearts farre off from him; be Hypocrites. But ſuch bee both the open and ſecret wicked in our aſſemblies: Therefore both the open and ſecret wicked in our aſſemblies are hypocrites. I am aſſured you vvill greatly maruell at me, and it may be ſome of you be ready to hiſſe at this, that <hi>the open wicked in our pariſh aſſemblies be hypocrites.</hi> Your ignorance herein hath been one principall cauſe of this falſe doctrine of yours. <hi>In the true viſible Church there are no open wicked, but it is a ſeparated company of righteous men:</hi> vpon
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18048:72"/> which falſe ground you condemne our pariſh aſſemblies to be falſe Churches, and therevpon haue departed from vs: which hath alſo cauſed mee to inſiſt ſo long vpon this point. You confeſſe there bee hypocrites in the Church according to the Scriptures: But you ſuppoſe them to bee ſuch as haue an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holineſſe, and ſuch as in charitie we cannot but accompt Saints or holy ones: whereas thoſe that make profeſsion of godlineſſe, though they haue no externall righteouſnes, nay be notoriouſly vvicked are hypocrites, vntill ſuch time as by excommunication they be cut off from the Church. And for the better ſatisfying of you herein, you muſt vnderſtand there be two ſorts of hypocrites: Firſt, cloſe hypocrites, vvhich are ſuch as goe in ſheeps clothing, when as indeed they be goats. Theſe are in appearance, Saints. If you looke vpon the outſide of theſe men, (and further for certaine wee cannot goe) I meane, the carriage of themſelues towards God, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to man, ſpecially to godward in the parts of his vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: you vvill thinke they be Saints indeede. Such a one was <hi>Iudas,</hi> vvhom none of the Apoſtles did diſcerne to bee an hypocrite; and ſo like to be the traytor <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſpake of: And <hi>Demas</hi> vnknowne for a time to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> And all thoſe it is probable <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. ſuch as theſe you accompt to bee hypocrites, and none other, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by M. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> vvho deſcribing Hypocrites ſaith they bee ſuch, <hi>As are outwardly religious,</hi>

                  <hi>but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly wicked, ſuch as aſhamed of their nakedneſſe, couer it with Fig-leaues of their owne externall righteouſneſſe.</hi> And againe, <hi>Hypocrites</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are they, who reſtrained by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Law from open wickednes, doe increaſe outwardly in righteouſneſſe.</hi> This kinde of hypocrites you only acknowledge: Whereupon it is that Maiſter <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in the ſame place permitting Hypocrites to be in the Church, doeth yet cleane ſhut out of the Church <hi>open wicked, licentious and prophane liuers:</hi> which cannot ſtand together, if any open wicked may be Hypocrites. But you muſt knowe that there is another ſort of Hypocrites, which bee not cloſe Hypocrites, and hardly diſcerned to be Hypocrites, and conſequently wicked: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen or manifeſt Hypocrites, eaſily knowne to be Hypocrites,

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18048:75"/> it is very hard to vnderſtand them of the viſible Churches and members thereof, rather then of the <hi>Churches</hi> themſelues. Neither can I conceiue, what there is in religion, or reaſon to leade vs from the litterall ſence, to your tropicall expoſition: ſpecially conſidering theſe kinde of ſpeeches be ſo frequent in the Epiſtles, and few or none to be found in them which can properly be ſaide of the viſible Churches.</p>
               <p>This is further confirmed by, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. but more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8.11.12.

And heere I reaſon thus. To what Church or ſocietie ſoeuer the miniſtery and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt were giuen, to the ſame the canonicall Epiſtles were written: But to the Church militant the miniſtery and Miniſteis were giuen: Therefore to it the Epiſtles canonicall were written.

               <p>Finally as the Apoſtles whiles they were limited and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the nation and people of the Iewee were ſent by Ieſus to Preach <hi>to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> that is, the elect Iſraelits:<note place="margin">Matth. 10.6.</note> ſo vndoubtedly when the Apo: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion was enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp; they to Preach to all nations, &amp; ſome of them to write, they were of Ieſus ſent and inſpired to Preach and write to the loſt ſheepe, that is, the elect of the Iewes and Gentiles.

If the pureſt Church that is be a mixt company, much more they that be leſſe pure. And who in their wits but would affirme, that ſuch a body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick were <hi>vnmixt, ſimple, and one,</hi> ſpecially that it were <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable in euery member vnto the head, and informed by one ſpirit?</hi> What euery member M. <hi>Robinſon?</hi> What proportion and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is there betweene Chriſt; and Hypocrites, many of which in the generall you acknowledge to be in the Church? Betwixt the ſonnes of God, and the children of the Diuell: ſome of which we muſt needs confeſſe to be in the Church? elſe all in the viſible Church are indeed the children of God, then which nothing is more falſe. If euery member be <hi>informed by the ſpirit of God,</hi> then euery one in the viſible Church hath the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating him. Indeede this M. <hi>Smith</hi> teacheth expreſſely, and all of you implicitely: But how truely I haue ſhewed, in the next Chapter. If euery one in this viſible Church, be informed by one and the ſame ſpirit, then if any in the viſible Church
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18048:90"/> haue the Spirit of God, all haue. And contrariwiſe: If any in the viſib. Church be informed by the vncleane ſpirit, all are. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer if euery member of the viſible Church <hi>bee called in one hope,</hi> then if any one in that viſible Church, haue that hope,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.24.</note> the end whereof is the ſaluation of mans ſoule, all haue it: and ſo on the contrarie, as before, Behold what concluſions doe follow from your premiſes: whereby wee may know how or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall they be. God forbid that all the Diuines in the world, ſhould teach ſuch poſitions as theſe. Hee hath itching cares vvho vvill rather giue care to you, and two or three ſuch more as your ſelfe, then all the Diuines in the world. Speake no more thus preſumptuouſly. You may remember vvhat ſometimes I ſaid vnto you mouth to mouth: The ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubiect to the Prophets, (that is) the doctrine (which all men conceit is from the ſpirit) of the prophets, is ſubiect to the iudgement of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>The ground of this your erring is not, that you thinke, that there are no wicked in the viſible Church, for you confeſſe that there are wicked in the viſible Church, yea men <hi>deſperately wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:</hi> but becauſe in your conceit, the wicked that be in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, are not true members of the viſible Church. That this is ſo, it appeareth by your words next following the former. <hi>And for wicked, and vngodly perſons ſo far are they from being the true naturall members whereof the body conſiſteth, as the whole of the parts,</hi>

The fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of this your conceit, I haue further diſcouered in the Chapter following, vvhereto I referre the Reader, onely in the meane ſeaſon remember this, and forget it not: That all vvhich bee in the viſible Church are members of it, vntill by excommunication they bee cut of: But (by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion) wicked men are in the viſible Church: therefore wicked men are members of it. Which if it bee true, all your doctrine (almoſt of the viſible Church is falſe.</p>
               <p>But to put an end to this point and part of your deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By the premiſes it is plaine, that a true viſible Church is not <hi>ſeperated from the world,</hi> that is, a company of righteous and godly men onely, ſeperated from the open wicked of the world. For if a viſible Church be a mixt company of good and bad, godly and vngodly, for which cauſe it is compared to a barne floore, to a field, and to a draw-net, as hath been ſhewed out of the holy Scriptures: againe if from time to time in the ages precedent, both vnder the Law and Goſpell there haue beene and remained in the true viſible Church vvicked, yea many wicked, and open wicked, as hath likewiſe been made manifeſt by the Scriptures: how can it poſsible be true which you affirme, <hi>That a viſible Church is a ſeperated companie of righteous men, not mixed with, but ſeperated from the wicked of the world?</hi> If this doctrine of yours be true, the one of theſe doe neceſſarily follow: either the former perſons of whom I haue ſpoken ſo much, <hi>Iſmael, Eſau, Doeg, Saul, Abſalom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The reſt of your deſcription I omit, as not greatly to bee found fault with, though ſomething might bee ſaid againſt it.

               <p>We hold (as hath already beene ſaide) men, not Angels, or any other creatures, but a company of men to be the matter of the viſible Church; and the profeſsion of true Religion to be the forme. So that whereſoeuer there is a company of men ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together in the profeſsion of true Religion, the ſame is, and may truely be called a viſible Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seperators</hi> teach otherwiſe, and firſt that <hi>Saints are the matter of the viſible Church:</hi> forgetting that a company of Saints are a Church by the Teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene ſhewed in the third Chapter of the firſt booke: and therefore ſuch a ſocietie containeth in it as well the forme as the matter, without both which nothing can be.</p>

               <p>This being conuinced by ſome of our ſide, <hi>M.

               <p>Firſt, then I demaund of you, who teach that <hi>Saints are a people forſaking all knowne ſinne, doing all the knowne will of God, increaſing in grace, &amp;c.</hi> And that <hi>ſuch are the onely matter of the viſible Church:</hi> whether a company of people thus qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18048:93"/> Synagogue of Satan. Surely you will bluſh and be aſhamed to anſwere negatiuely. And if you anſwere, that ſuch a ſocietie is a Church, then haue we a Church conſiſting onely of matter, without the forme for ſuch a people as theſe (ſay you) are <hi>the matter of a true viſible Church,</hi> wherevnto the forme remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to bee added, which what it is you tell vs after. Now you know it is vtterly vnpoſsible that a Church (or any thing elſe) ſhould be without the forme: ſeeing <hi>the forme giues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a thing,</hi> but ſet downe after another manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it cannot bee denied but ſuch Saints as theſe, are <hi>Conuerts;</hi> yea ſo farre as man can iudge truely conuerted to the Lord. If the Church conſiſt of ſuch perſons onely, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neceſſarily therevpon that men are conuerted, not in the Church by the Miniſterie of the Paſtors and Teachers thereof, but without, I know not by whom, nor by what meanes: which is as falſe, as your ſeperation is ſinfull, and therefore is this your doctrine falſe from whence this is inferred.</p>
               <p>Indeed I know that this inference is with you orthodoxall: For in your <hi>Apologie</hi> among the <hi>Poſitions</hi> you were bold to tender to his Maieſtie this is one: <hi>That diſcreet, faithfull,<note place="margin">Apology 45.</note> and able men though not yet in office of Miniſterie, may bee appointed to preach the Goſpell and whole truth of God: that men being firſt brought to knowledge and conuerted to the Lord, may then be ioyned in holy communion with Chriſt our head, and one with an other.</hi> And for confirmation therof you produce ſeuenteene teſtimonies of holy writ, and ſeuen reaſons. But to let your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Scripture, and of that reaſon which God hath giuen you goe: I tell you this doctrine and <hi>poſition</hi> of yours is againſt Scripture, and therefore as impoſsible to be proued either by Scripture or Reaſon. By the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> it is plaine that Chriſt aſcending on high <hi>gaue Paſtors and Teachers</hi> to the Church; as well <hi>for the gathering together of the Saints,</hi> that is, for the calling of men to the faith, or conuerting them to God, whereby men before profane and wicked, are made Saints or holy ones: as <hi>for the edifying</hi> and building vp of theſe Saints in the faith, and other graces of the Spirit, after they be called. You teach now the direct contrary: that Chriſt hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his Miniſters, Paſtors and Teachers to the former of theſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18048:94"/> ends aforeſaid, which is alſo the principall, but hath (ſay you) appointed, that <hi>men not in the Miniſtery,</hi> but priuate, <hi>(no Church officers)</hi> ſhould <hi>conuert men to the Lord:</hi> and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt are onely to edifie and build them vp in grace. So that priuate men they lay the foundation, Miniſters doe but onely erect and build further vpon that which they haue laid. Theſe <hi>diſcreete priuate men</hi> they alone are fathers, begetting men to the faith, and as for the Miniſters they are but nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to giue ſucke, nouriſh and bring vp men in it. Thus you doe not onely croſſe this Scripture, and ordinance of Chriſt, who hath perpetually appointed Paſtors and Teachers in the Church to the aboue-named ends: but doe alſo hereby prefer priuate mens teachings aboue Miniſters. For is it not a matter of great power and excellencie <hi>to conuert</hi> men vnto God, then to <hi>confirme</hi> them that be conuerted? and to beget men to the faith, then to nouriſh them that are begotten? <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord open your eyes</hi> that you may ſee your errour. But leauing this, hearken what further reaſons we haue againſt your <hi>deſcription of Saints, and matter of the viſible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I haue in the former Chapter ſhewed that many haue been members of the viſible Church that haue wanted, externall holineſſe, yea being outwardly and openly prophane: this to a wiſe man may ſuffice for the confutation of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, yea of all that you teach concerning both the matter and forme of the viſible Church. <hi>Cain, Iſmael, Eſau, Saul, Doeg, Ioab, Abſalom, Iudas,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſes were all of the viſible Church, and yet not thus qualified.

               <p>Ye now which teach glorious things of all the members of the viſible Church, anſwere mee. Were all in the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> ſuch <hi>Saints</hi> as you ſpeake of? Were they that denied the reſurrection; that were giuen to ſtrife, enuying, wrath, contentions, backbitings, whiſperings, ſwellings and diſcord; that liued in vncleanneſſe, fornication, and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that denied <hi>Paul</hi> to be an Apoſtle, diſgraced and deſpiſed both him and his preachings traduced and ſlaundered him: Were theſe (I ſay) <hi>ſeperated from all knowne ſinne, and did all the knowne will of God</hi> ſo farre as men can iudge?

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18048:96"/> theſe that externall righteouſneſſe, and outward ſanctimonie or holineſſe, which you ſay all in the viſible Church haue? <hi>M. Robinſon</hi> in a large Treatiſe of his lately ſet foorth,<note place="margin">Iuſtif. 107.</note> hath theſe words: <hi>It is all one</hi> M. Bernard <hi>as if you ſhould ſay, the Scriptures doe not call men Saints, becauſe they are Saints, but for ſome other cauſes knowne to you. For what is it to be a Saint, but to be holy? And what to be holy, but to be of a ſound iudgement, pure affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and vnblameable conuerſation?</hi> That which this man heere ſaith, they all doe hold, and this is one ſpeciall ſtone whereat they often ſtumble. I demaund therefore of them all, whether all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> I ſpeake of were ſuch <hi>Saints</hi> and holy ones as they teach all in the viſible Church are: and namely whether they were <hi>of a ſound iudgement, pure affections, and vnblameable conuerſation?</hi> If they anſwere affirmatiuely that they were; all men will cry, fye vpon it: and then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon in the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp; the falſe teachers among the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſuch, to wit, <hi>men of a ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pure affections, &amp; vnblamable conuerſation.</hi> If they anſwer negatiuely, then (foraſmuch as theſe were in the Church) ſome are in the Church, who are not Saints and ſo to be called, which is againſt their owne doctrine; or then ſome are in the church who are not ſuch Saints, as theſe men ſay all in the viſible church are and muſt be.</p>
               <p>And here we are to remember theſe things. 1. That many of the perſons we ſpeake of were openly wicked. That theſe were godly men, and Saints indeede, hauing their hearts purified by Faith, no man (ſure) will affirme. If they were not godly, then which muſt needes be true of ſome of them, I meane the falſe teachers among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> becauſe againſt them <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or prayeth thus:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Would to God they were euen cut of, which doe diſquiet you:</hi> which hee would neuer haue done had they beene godly. And if they were wicked then openly wicked, and knowne to be ſo, becauſe their ſins were open and knowne to men. 2. Wee muſt remember, that theſe Churches when <hi>S. Paul</hi> writ vnto them were true viſible Churches: which muſt needes bee, becauſe by the holy Ghoſt they are ſo called and intituled: and this the <hi>Separiſtes</hi> doe readily acknowledge, yea that they were of the pureſt Churches that haue beene.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18048:96"/> 3. That all the members of a true viſible Church are Saints by nomination; ſo called in Scripture: and conſequently all theſe aforeſaide in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatia.</hi> This alſo the <hi>Separiſtes</hi> will freely confeſſe. 4. We muſt know that all which be once admitted into the church, do remaine members of the ſame Church (be they neuer ſo wicked) vntill either they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues depart from it, or elſe by excommunication be caſt out: and that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently all the ſcandalous perſons aforeſaid were in and of the Church, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a the inceſtuous man till hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. This they of the Seperation will likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be true.</p>
               <p>Now from the premiſes theſe two concluſions doe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow. 1. That a ſocietie of men wherein be ſundry wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yea openly wicked, may notwithſtanding be a true church. 2. That the open wicked and ſcandalous perſons in the church are <hi>Saints</hi> by nomination: and <hi>the Scripture doe ſometimes call men Saints, not becauſe they are holy, but for ſome other cauſes or reſpects,</hi> whereof hath beene ſpoken in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Browniſts</hi> teach concluſions directly contrary to theſe, which is the cauſe of their erring ſo groſſely in the doctrine of the viſible Church, and the principall cauſe of their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Church to be a falſe Church, and conſequently of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating from vs. But whether they or wee doe herein agree with the Scriptures, let the Chriſtian Reader iudge.</p>
               <p>Some other arguments did I long ſince ſet down againſt your aforeſaide <hi>deſcription,</hi> and this <hi>That ſuch Saints as thoſe you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribe, be the onely matter of the viſible Church:</hi> which <hi>M. Bernard</hi> hauing thought of alſo, and publiſhed, and <hi>M. Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> lately anſwered: I thought it ther fore beſt rather to ſpend ſome lines about a reply to <hi>M. Robinſon,</hi> then inlarging and preſſing thoſe arguments. It is true that both <hi>M. Ainſworth,</hi> and <hi>M. Smith</hi> haue likewiſe anſwered that Booke of <hi>M. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards,</hi> wherein the reaſons I meane are contained,<note place="margin">The title of this booke is, Separatiſts, Schiſme.</note> but we muſt know that there is nothing worth the anſwering in <hi>M. Smith,</hi> which <hi>M. Robinſon</hi> hath not, and as for <hi>M. Ainſworth,</hi> hee <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes</hi> both <hi>the poſition, &amp; the errors that be gathered from it,</hi> as before we haue heard, ſo that if <hi>M.

But we muſt knowe that for as much as the viſible Church through the corruption of man, not by Gods appointment, hath in it as well bad men, as good; wicked as godly, and that in appearance and outward ſhewe, as well as in deede and trueth: that therefore euen by your owne reaſon we cannot deeme all of the viſible Church to be Elect, and of the inuiſible Church. They that were of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> familie, which then was the Church, could not well iudge mocking <hi>Iſmael;</hi> nor they of <hi>Iſaaks</hi> familie, prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> to be Elect, and of the inuiſible Church. The ſame may be ſaide of <hi>Saule, Ioab, Abſalom,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees whom to haue iudged to be of the inuiſible Church, had beene no better then to account them good, which were euill.

Firſt, cloſe hypocrites, which being goates and children of darknes, doe yet goe in ſheepes clothing, and are like to the children of light, hauing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall righteouſneſſe. Such vvere <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Demas.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.24.</note> open or manifeſt hypocrites, ſuch as <hi>Iſmael, Eſau, Abſalon,</hi> with others. The firſt kinde of hypocrites cannot bee knowne in particular, vntill the Lord be pleaſed to vncaſe them: but the other are at all times as eaſie to be diſcerned in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by them vvho can diſcerne of ſpirits, and betweene things and perſons that differ, as it is to know tares from wheate, and goates from ſheepe.</p>
               <p>And vvhere you ſay that <hi>hypocrites being diſcouered, they are no longer to be reteined in the Church, except they repent, and then who can repute them hypocrites.</hi> I confeſſe all this to be very true. But what if through the corruption that is in men; their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, partialitie, or remiſſenes, ſuch hypocrites bee not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, but remaine ſtill in the Church: Is therefore the ſaid ſocietie becauſe of this impunitie become no church, or a falſe church? Anſwere vs I pray you: for this queſtion commeth to the quick: If you anſwere affirmatiuely, that ſuch a ſocietie notwithſtanding the vvicked that be in it is a true Church: you doe at one puſh put downe a great deale of that rotten building you haue been a long time ſetting vp. If negatiuely, then I will not feare to affirme, that neither the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18048:98"/> Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor ſundry of the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> were true Churches, when the Apoſtle writ vnto them, which vvere blaſphemie to affirme.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Bernard</hi> obiecteth further, that <hi>this makes</hi> Dauid, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat, <hi>and the Church of God in their dayes to be no true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a viſible Church: for there was marrying many wiues, the continuance of the high places, the brazen ſerpent worſhipped,</hi> Ioabs <hi>murder permitted, the bill of diuorcement allowed by</hi> Moſes.</p>

                  <hi>I doe anſwere to this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, firſt, that you cannot proue the holy men you name to haue ſinned in all the particulars wherewith you charge them: much leſſe that they were conuinced of ſinne in ſuffering theſe things, and yet ſuffered them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply. Be it they ſinned not in all the aforeſaid particulars, yet did they in ſome of them: and what ſay you to them? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> both ſinned <hi>in ſuffering</hi> Ioabs <hi>murder, and was in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> alſo <hi>conuinced thereof:</hi> from whence it came that in his laſt will (as I may ſay) he chargeth <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſonne concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Ioab,</hi> that as he had ſhed bloud, ſo he ſhould cauſe his to be ſhed,<note place="margin">1.

Now M. <hi>Robinſon</hi> anſwere me. Was <hi>Dauid</hi> in and during this time in the Church, or without? You cannot but acknowledge that hee remained at this time in the Church, and was a member thereof. But <hi>Dauid</hi> now was not <hi>ſeperated from all knowne ſinne, did not practiſe all the knowne will of God, increaſe in grace, and therein continue,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as at this time he liued in knowne ſinnes, and decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in grace: <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore was matter of the viſible Church, and yet not ſuch a Saint as you deſcribe: and conſequently your doctrine is falſe that ſuch Saints as you here deſcribe are the on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Reply. Theſe examples were not inſtanced to countenance the profane among vs: but to diſproue <hi>your deſcription of Saints, and that ſuch Saints are not the onely matter of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church:</hi> and therevnto they ſerue very well, which is all that was by M: <hi>Barnard</hi> intended. For thus in effect he reaſoneth: <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> vvere matter of the viſible Church: for they were true members of a true viſ. Church: But they vvere not ſuch Saints as you define Saints to bee: Therefore ſuch Saints as you define, are not the onely matter of the viſible Church. But to draw little neerer vnto you: euen in <hi>Dauids</hi> time,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.1.</note> much more in worſer times, there was no leſſe profane and graceleſſe a multitude in the Church of <hi>Iudah,</hi> then is in the Church of England at this day: Wherevpon <hi>Dauid</hi> complaineth thus. <hi>Helpe Lord, for there is not a godly man left: the faithfull are failed from among the children of men: they ſpeake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour, flattering with their lips, and ſpeake with a double heart.</hi> Which though it doe not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the vngodly among vs, yet it manifeſtly diſproueth your definition of <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſuppoſed matter of the viſible Church: and proueth demonſtratiuely that a people may bee a true Church, notwithſtanding there be in it wicked men, nay a multitude of profane and graceleſſe men: as <hi>Iudah</hi> vvas in the dayes of <hi>Dauid, Vzziah, Iotham, Hezekiah,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>Iudah:</hi>

That <hi>not one Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth is brought by you to proue the holineſſe of the viſible Church, which is meant of the inuiſible:</hi> You teach<note n="k" place="margin">Iuſtification 115.</note> that <hi>all of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church were purchaſed with the bloud of God; were all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the grace of God, hauing effectuall faith, diligent loue, and patient hope in the Lord Ieſus, growing in grace euery one of them.</hi> And for proofe of theſe poſitions and a few ſuch like

               <p>Againe in the ſame place to proue the <hi>holines of the viſ. church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iuſtif. 115.</note> you tell vs (m) that the viſible Church <hi>bee ſuch and none other, as are not of the world, but choſen out of it, and hated of it, as do re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue the word, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all things gladly, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath neede and that in gladneſſe and ſinglenes of heart, and haue receiued teſtimony by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe that they were ſuch as ſhould be ſaued.</hi> And for confirmation therof you quote. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.18.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17-16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.42 46.47. I would as ſoone beleeue you, if you ſhould teach: that all in the viſible church ſhall be ſaued. For I pray you, are not they ſure to be ſaued, of whome the holy Ghoſt teſtifieth, that they ſhall be ſaued? But this teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt (ſay you) all and euery one of the viſible Church haue. Therefore all and euery one of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church ſhall bee ſaued, and none therein bee damned. Thus many teſtimonies in holy Scripture, which are onely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, are meant, and true of the inuiſible Church, you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the viſible Church, and apply to that ſocietie: and yet ſpare not to ſay, that <hi>you bring not one Scripture, meant of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church, and apply it to the viſible.</hi> Let the Reader now iudge, whether herein you ſpeake truely, or the contrary impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ours be iuſt.</p>
               <p>As touching. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>M. Robinſon</hi> hath foure arguments to prooue that it is meant and to be vnderſtood of the viſible Church, and therefore not of the inuiſible, his firſt argument is this.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to the viſible Church of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Iuſtif. 44.</note> and not to the inuiſible among them, then in <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.9. Hee ſpeaketh of the viſible Church, and not of the inuiſible.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to the viſible Church of the Iewes, and nor to the inuiſible among them.</p>
               <p>Therfore in Chap. 2.9. he ſpeaketh to the viſible Church of the Iewes, and not of the inuiſible.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:18048:101"/>
               <p>The propoſition or conſequence of this argument which we deny as being palpablie falſe, he indeuoureth not to proue at all: to wit, that to whomſoeuer <hi>Peter</hi> writ of them all that which he writ muſt be meant and vnderſtood: which no man of vnderſtanding will graunt.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption he ſtrengthens with ſundry reaſons; as firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to that Church and ſocietie whereof hee was the Apoſtle: But he was the Apoſtle of the viſible Church of the Iewes: Ergo, <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to the viſible Church of the Iewes, and conſequently not to the inuiſible. 2. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to that Church and ſocietie which he knewe. But hee did knowe the viſible Church, and not the inuiſible, which is knowne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he wrote to the viſible Church, and not to the inuiſible. Theſe proofes he inſerts in his firſt reaſon: but not content therwith, he confirmes his aſſumption with two more arguments laide downe in his third and fourth reaſons.</p>
               <p>To that Church <hi>Peter</hi> writ wherein were Elders and a flocke depending vpon them.</p>
               <p>But the viſible Church had Elders and a flocke depending vpon them, and not the inuiſible.</p>
               <p>Therefore to the viſ, Church <hi>Peter</hi> write, &amp; not to the inuiſ.</p>
               <p>Againe to that Church which had the word of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them the Apoſtles did write.</p>
               <p>But the word was preached to the viſible Church:</p>
               <p>Therefore to it he writ.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of theſe three arguments, 1.3. &amp; 4. is this, <hi>Peter</hi> writ to the viſible Church, <hi>Ergo:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. cannot be meant of the inuiſible Church; but of the viſible. By this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I can prooue, that the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> excepted: in all the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> there is nothing meant of the inuiſible Church: Becauſe the ſaide Epiſtles were written as you ſay to the viſible Church. Alſo that nothing in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> are ſpoken either, of the inuiſible or viſible church, But of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The foundation whereof is, that to whomſoeuer an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writ an Epiſtle, of them all in that Epiſtle is ſpoken, and to be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deny your aſſumption, and affirme that <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:18048:101"/> writ to the Church; whereby I meane the ſame which we call the inuiſible Church, and euen ſo did the reſt of the Apoſtles, thoſe Epiſtles excepted which were written to ſome ſpeciall perſon. For the miniſtery is giuen to the Church, or Saints and Body of Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12. Which Body the inuiſible Church is, and not the viſible: And heere I reaſon thus, as I haue once before. To what Church or ſocietie the miniſtery and Miniſters were giuen of Chriſt, to the ſame the Canonicall Epiſtles were written: But to the Church militant the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Miniſters were giuen: therfore to it the Epiſtles were written. The propoſition is manifeſt, the aſſumption <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12. doeth clearely prooue. We may remember alſo, heere how <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, writeth expreſſely and by name, <hi>to the Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſanctification of the</hi> Spirit: and in the ſecond thus: <hi>Peter to you which haue obtained like precious Faith with vs:</hi> which Faith onely the elect haue, and therfore is the ſame in effect with the former, <hi>Peter to the Elect, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The propoſition is grounded vpon this certaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted trueth, that where matter &amp; forme of a true viſ. church is, there is a true church.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption, to wit, that euery people gathered and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, is not a true viſ.

But leauing this man, let vs heare what <hi>M. Smith</hi> ſayeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Principles and Inferences. 11.</note>
                  <hi>The true forme</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of a true viſible Church is partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, partly outward. The inward part of the forme conſiſteth in three things.</hi> 1. <hi>the Spirit,</hi> 2. <hi>Faith,</hi> 3. <hi>Loue. The Spirit is the ſoule animating the whole body, Faith vniteth the members of the body to the head Chriſt Ieſus, Loue vniteth the members of the body each to other. The outward part thereof is, a vowe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, oath, or couenant betwixt God and the Saints.</hi> Euery peece and parcell hereof he ſeemeth to himſelfe and to his Diſciples to proue ſubſtantially, he alleadgeth no leſſe then twelue teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture for the proofe of one point.</p>
               <p>Reply. <hi>The forme,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is partly inward and partly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> Then the matter of the viſible Church muſt bee ſo too: except he will haue a forme without matter, which I know you will not ſay. Tell vs therefore, what is the inward matter of the viſible Church, and what is the outward: for aſſuredly wee know not. But let this goe. <hi>The inward forme is the Spirit, Faith, Loue.</hi> One would thinke that this was rather the forme of the Church militant: conſidering theſe three, <hi>Spirit, Faith, Loue,</hi> are onely to be found in the elect, and cannot fall into
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18048:102"/> any reprobate, whereof the viſible Church conſiſteth for a great part. And firſt as touching the <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is proper to the choſen, as is manifeſt by <hi>Romans</hi> 8.14.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.<note place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> And for this cauſe <hi>Faith</hi> is called <hi>the Faith of Gods elect,</hi> becauſe I ſay it is proper to the elect of God: which is further confirmed by that in the <hi>Acts,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſpirit,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>is the ſoule animating the whole body.</hi> By <hi>whole body</hi> he vnderſtands the whole viſible Church: and his meaning is, that as the body of man and all the members and parts thereof are animated, that is, are quickened and receiue naturall or corporall life from the ſoule: ſo the whole viſible Church, and all the members thereof haue ſpirituall life from the Spirit of God. From whence this neceſſarily followeth, that euery one of the viſible Church hath the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.10.11.</note> quickening him to righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of life here: and to immortalitie and eternall life in the world to come. For both theſe effects the ſpirit worketh in whomſoeuer it is, and is there fore-called <hi>the ſpirit of life.</hi> The which if it bee true,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> I meane, that euery member of the viſible Church hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, as all of you doe (in effect) teach, and namely as oft as you doe tell vs that <hi>a true viſible Church is the bodie of Chriſt:</hi> then in the viſible Church there are none dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſinnes; no dead, but all liuing ſtones: foraſmuch as the whole body, and conſequently euery member thereof, is animated and quickned by the Spirit, from whence floweth ſpirituall life and motion. Then in the viſible church there be no hypocrites, nor carnall or naturall men, no wicked perſon, neither openly nor ſecretly wicked: for as much as euery member of the viſible church hath the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Apology 44. Counterp. 127.</note> euen the ſpirit of life, or quickening ſpirit: vvhich in whomſoeuer it is mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſinne in them, crucifieth their fleſh and naturall corruption freeing them from the power and dominion thereof: and quickneth or inableth them to leade an holy and ſpirituall life. Laſtly then in the viſ. church there bee no Reprobates, none that ſhall bee damned: for as much as euery one in the viſible
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18048:103"/> church hath the Spirit of God, and ſo the ſpirit of life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with whoſoeuer is indued hath not onely ſpirituall, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life begun in him, and therefore ſhall neuer die. And here we may remember that <hi>the ſpirit of God is beſtowed onely vpon Gods children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.14.17.</note> all which be heares of ſaluation. Alſo that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is called <hi>the ſeale and earneſt of our inheritance:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note> vvhereby wee learne, That whoſoeuer hath the ſpirit, he hath the earneſt and ſeale of God of his heauenly inheritance, and ſo is ſure to be ſaued. But the vvhole body of the viſ. Church ſay you hath this ſpirit animating it. Therefore conclude I all and euery one of the viſ. Church are ſure to be ſaued, and ſo there be in it no Reprobates, nor ſuch as ſhall be damned. This concluſion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth alſo neceſſarily from that you doe adde: <hi>Faith vniteth the members of the body to the head Chriſt. By body</hi> here you meane <hi>the whole viſible Church:</hi> and ſo teach firſt, that all the members of the viſ. Church bee vnited to Chriſt, as to their head. Secondly, that euery one of the viſ. Church hath that faith, which maketh this vnion, or vniteth him to Chriſt his head. Doth it not now from hence follow, that all of the viſ. Church be heyres of ſaluation, and that none of them ſhall paſſe into condemnation?<note place="margin">Joh. 10.26. &amp; 27.</note> For who can plucke from Chriſt, that is vnited vnto him, and is as it vvere part of him? Or can any member of his die, ſeeing to euery one of them hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth life, both ſpirituall and eternall? Can any alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with this effectuall faith be condemned? <hi>Hee that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth hath euerlaſting life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.17.36. &amp; 5 24. Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                  <hi>is ſaued already, and hath paſſed from death to life: to him there is no condemnation,</hi> That vvhich hee ſaith here of <hi>the ſpirit animating the whole body,</hi> (euen as the ſoule doth the whole body of man) if he had ſpoken &amp; meant it of the Church, without adding or vnderſtanding <hi>viſible,</hi> the one of the which you alwaies doe: and by <hi>body</hi> vnderſtood the miſticall body of Chriſt, and by <hi>a member</hi> an elect veſſell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and brought to the faith, then had hee ſpoken truely: but vnderſtanding by <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and by a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one particular perſon of that ſocietie hee teacheth that which is very falſe.</p>
               <p>There ſhift and euaſion I know will be this, that they do not meane that all the viſ. Church haue indeede <hi>the Spirit, Faith
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18048:103"/> and Loue,</hi> but only externally, &amp; ſo far as men can iudge. This is abſurd. For in this they ſecretly imply, that there are ſome in the viſ. Church which haue not the ſpirit, nor faith, nor loue: and in this poſitiue Diuinitie of yours directly teach the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. For <hi>the ſpirit</hi> (ſay you) <hi>animateth the whole body.</hi> If the whole body then all the members thereof, and conſequently, there is no member that is deſtitute of the ſpirit. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may not alleadge for your ſelfe, except you vvill contradict your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>After theſe men comes M. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and hee fully agreeing with M. <hi>Smith</hi> concerning the matter of the viſ. Church, doth yet differ from them both about the forme: and tels vs, that the couenant is the forme. <hi>Saints</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is the matter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iuſtiff. 88. &amp; 82.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Couenant the forme, from which two concurring the Church ariſeth.</hi> Hereby he and M. <hi>Smith</hi> (who makes it the outward part of the forme) meane a ſolemne vow, oath, promiſe, or Couenant made to God of thoſe that be of yeeres of diſcretion, to renounce Idolatry, and to cleaue to God, and to euery part of his truth.</p>
               <p>For the diſcouerie and conuincing of this your errour, wee muſt remember that the oath and couenant which King <hi>Aſa</hi> and his ſubiects made <hi>to ſeeke the Lord God of their Fathers,</hi> (from whence theſe men fetch this doctrine) was in the 15. yeere of <hi>Aſa,</hi> as is ſaid 2. <hi>Chron,</hi> 15.10. and that he reformed the Church, and reſtored the true Religion and worſhip of God, in the beginning and entrance into his kingdome, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 14. and 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 15.14. This couenant therefore cannot poſsibly be the forme of the Church, ſeeing <hi>Iudah</hi> was a true church in <hi>Aſia</hi> his dayes before they made this couenant, and a thing can not bee or haue exiſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the forme. And here we may remember that this vow and promiſe (in effect) we make, and paſſe into this couenant in baptiſme, when and whereby we are recciued and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the church.

For which cauſe, he is there called <hi>the Father of many nations,</hi> that is the Father of all that beleeue of what nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoeuer: and had his name changed from <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> and a litle before is ſaide to be <hi>the Father of vs all:</hi> as if the Apoſtle had ſaide, the father of my ſelfe, and of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. This is confirmed and made more plaine in the 11. verſ. of the aforeſaide Chapter. <hi>Abraham receiued the ſigne of circumciſion, at the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of the Faith which he had when he was vncircumciſed, that he ſhould bee the Father of all them that beleeue, not being circumciſed, that righteouſneſſe might be imputed to them alſo.</hi> 12. <hi>And the father of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is, of the circumciſed, or of the Iewes, <hi>not vnto them onely which beleeue and are of the circumciſion but vnto them alſo of the Gentiles, that walke in the ſteppes of the faith of our Father Abraham,</hi> that is, beleeue as he did, <hi>which faith he had when hee was vncircumciſed.</hi> And againe, verſ. 16. <hi>Therefore it is by faith,</hi> (meaning the heauenly inheritance) <hi>that it might come by grace, and the promiſe that God made to</hi> Abraham, <hi>might be ſure to all the ſeede: not to that onely which is of the Law,</hi> that is, not to the Iewes onely who beleeue, and were vnder the Lawe giuen by God to <hi>Moſes: but alſo to that which is of the faith of Abraham,</hi> that is, to the Gentiles, who beleeue as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And reſtraineth the couenant to <hi>Izhak</hi> onely, and to his ſeed, that is to them who ſhould beleeue in Chriſt, as <hi>Izhak</hi> did; to the Elect I ſay, of whom he was a figure. We muſt heere remember that <hi>Abraham</hi> his family was the viſible Church. For from the beginning of the world to the giuing of the Lawe, the viſible Church was ſhut vp in the families of the Patriarcks. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, I reaſon thus againſt you. If the couenant of grace and ſaluation was made with the viſi: Church, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, then with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> becauſe hee was of the viſible Church: But it was not made with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> as this place of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> prooueth: Ergo, not with the viſible Church: but with the inuiſible as we affirme.</p>
               <p>And this is further confirmed, Rom. 9.6. <hi>Notwithſtanding it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18048:106"/> cannot be that the word of God ſhould take none effect: for all they are not Iſrael,</hi> that is, t e <hi>Iſrael</hi> to whom God made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eterall life, <hi>which are of Iſrael,</hi> that is defended of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. 7. <hi>Neither are they all children, becauſe they are the ſeede of</hi> Abraham, <hi>but in</hi> Iſaack <hi>ſhall thy ſeede be called,</hi> 8. <hi>That is, they which are the children of the fleſhe, are not the children of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: <hi>but the children of the promiſe, are counted for the ſeede.</hi> For the better vnderſtanding of this Scripture, we muſt knowe that the Apoſtle being to ſpeake of the reiection of the Iewes, anſwereth an obiection that would readily be made againſt the ſame. If God haue caſt away the Iewes, then is the promiſe that God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede fruſtrate, and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: which cannot be ſo: Therefore God hath not reiected them. This obiection is contained in theſe words: <hi>It cannot be that the word of God ſhould take none effect.</hi> Whereby the <hi>word of God</hi> is meant, the promiſe that God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his poſteritie: <hi>I will be God vnto thee and to thy ſeede after thee. Paul</hi> anſwereth, It followeth not that God is vnfaithfull and keepeth not the promiſe of grace and life which hee made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede, though his poſteritie, the Iſraelits be reiected of God &amp; damned: becauſe this couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or promiſe of life euerlaſting, the Lord made not with thoſe who ſhould be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children according to the fleſh, not (I ſay) with that carnall Iſrael, that is, the Iewes who ſhould lineally deſcend from <hi>Abraham:</hi> but with the Spirituall Iſrael, or children of <hi>Abraham</hi> in a ſpirituall ſence, that is, the elect, or thoſe that ſhould beleeue in God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, whether they were Iewes or Gentiles. So long therefore as the Lord reiecteth not and damneth the elect of the Iewes and Gentiles the true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but receiueth them to grace, and in his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus giueth to them life eternall, he is faithfull, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his promiſe and couenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeede: Albeit the reſt of the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the fleſh, or people of Iſrael, and of the viſible Church be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And here obſerue that theſe <hi>children of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> are called, firſt, <hi>the children of promiſe,</hi> as being ſuch children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that were not begotten of him by the force of Nature, or by carnall generation: but ſuch as ſhould

Secondly they are called <hi>the children of God. They</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which are the children of the fleſh, are not the children of God, but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeede.</hi> Heere the ſame are meant by <hi>the children of God, the children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and the <hi>ſeede,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Whereby wee learne, that God made this promiſe or couenant of grace with thoſe onely, whom in Ieſus Chriſt he adopteth into the number of his children. But the elect and inuiſible Church onely are Gods children, they alone alſo are the children of the promiſe: Therefore with them onely God hath made the couenant of grace: and not with the viſ. Church, no more then with <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> members thereof: as the Apoſtle ſheweth here in the verſes next following. And for this cauſe it may bee the elect are called <hi>the children of the promiſe:</hi> becauſe the promiſe of Grace and Life God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> belongeth onely to them. Theſe <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>true beleeuers</hi> are they who are <hi>counted for the ſeede</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with whom this couenant was made, as it is ſaide, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. and not the naturall poſteritie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſome Iewes imagined, and it may be, doc at this day: nor yet the viſible Church as you no leſſe carnally conceiue then theſe Iewes. This controuerſie betwixt you and vs, one would thinke ſhould now be ended, conſidering how clearely the trueth ſhineth on our ſide: yet for feare it prooue otherwiſe, I will adde ſomething more.</p>
               <p>In the third to the <hi>Galathians, verſe</hi> 29. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith thus to them: <hi>And if ye be Chriſts, then are yee</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeede, and heires by promiſe:</hi> As if he had ſaid: If yee beleeue in Chriſt, whereby you are made one with him, then are ye indeede the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heires of eternall life according to the promiſe God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> From hence I reaſon thus.</p>
               <p>All they and onely they who be Chriſts, that is, are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into him by faith, are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternall life is made.</p>
               <p>But all of the church inuiſible and onely they are Chriſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him by faith:</p>
               <p>Therefore all of the inuiſible church, and onely they are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:18048:107"/> ſeede, to whom the promiſe of eternall life is made.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is proued by theſe words of the Apoſtle: <hi>If Chriſts, then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeede.</hi> The Aſſumption needs no proofe. Againe, I argue from hence thus againſt you.</p>
               <p>If the viſ. Church be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, and they to vvhom the promiſe of ſaluation was made, then the viſ. Church, and conſequently all the members thereof, are heires of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>But this latter is falſe:</p>
               <p>Therefore the firſt.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption you will not deny: and the Propoſition is as cleare by this Scripture: and needs muſt be true, ſeeing God is faithfull and conſtant in the performance of his promiſe: which he could not be if any one of thoſe ſhould goe to hell, to whom he hath made promiſe of heauen. <hi>God is not as man,</hi>

                  <hi>though euery man be a lyar.</hi> If therefore God haue made a couenant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſaluation vvith the viſ. Church, as you all affirme, and ſpecially M. <hi>Smith</hi> euer and anone in his <hi>Parralleles,</hi> then all of the viſible Church ſhall be ſaued. But for as much as many of that ſocietie ſhall be damned, it cannot be that to them this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made, but to ſome other company, euen to the heires of ſaluation. And this latter may bee confirmed, and ſo you conuinced by your owne words. <hi>By faith</hi> (ſaith M. <hi>Ainſworth) we are the ſeede of</hi> Abraham, (<hi>and conſequently heires by promiſe of the bleſſed inheritance, and ſo doe enter into his reſt.</hi>

And heere I reaſon thus from your owne words.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18048:108"/> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with whom God made that gracious couenant of life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is your owne: the Aſſumption I truſt you abhor to deny: imbrace therefore the concluſion, wherevpon neceſſarily followeth, that God made not this couenant with the viſ. Church, as all of you doe teach: but with the inuiſible, as wee affirme.</p>
               <p>But you tell vs, that 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8. doth proue this. <hi>Bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe profiteth little: but godlineſſe is profitable vnto all things, which hath the promiſe of the life preſent, and of that that is to come.</hi> Here is mention indeede of a promiſe concerning life eternall.

But ſuch onely are the elect and inuiſible Church: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them, and not to the viſible Church, is the promiſe made of life euerlaſting by Chriſt. So that this Scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth againſt you.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, you alleadge here. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>According as his diuine power hath giuen vnto vs all things that pertaine to life and godlines. Peter</hi> here telleth vs that all good things belonging to life eternall are giuen vs of God: But to whom? To the viſible Church? We reade no ſuch thing, but cleane otherwiſe. <hi>To vs,</hi> ſaith he. As if he had ſaid, to me and the reſt of the elect. That by <hi>life</hi> here, the Apoſtle meaneth life eternall, no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Neither that life eternall ſhall bee giuen vnto them, to whom all things appertaining to that life are giuen. Seeing then the inuiſible Church onely, haue <hi>all things pertaining to life giuen them of God,</hi> foraſmuch as they onely enioy that life, and that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of them who are made partakers of this gift: it followeth neceſſarily therevpon, that hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth onely of the inuiſible church. Obſerue beſides, that hee ſaith not onely that <hi>God hath giuen vs all things that appertaine vnto life,</hi> but addeth, <hi>and godlineſſe.</hi> Implying thereby, that they to whom this life is giuen of God, haue firſt all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining vnto godlineſſe beſtowed vpon them in this life, before they enioy that life eternall in the world to come. But to the inuiſible Church onely all things pertaining to godlineſſe are giuen: Therefore of the inuiſible Church the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh, and not of the viſible, as you affirme. And here

               <p>But let vs briefely and in order conſider of theſe or the moſt of them If the viſible Church be <hi>a kingdome of Prieſtes,</hi> and <hi>royall Prieſthood,</hi> then all of this Church &amp; company are Kings and Prieſts vnto God: but the laſt is falſe: therefore the firſt.

The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which is this: <hi>All of the viſible Church are not Kings and Prieſtes vnto God,</hi> with open mouth you deny: which thus I prooue.</p>
               <p>All that be Kings and Prieſts vnto God ſhall raigne, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to God the ſacrifice of praiſe for euer in heauen.</p>

               <p>Therefore all of the viſible Church be not Kings and prieſts vnto God.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is in it ſelfe cleare. The propoſition is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Thou waſt killed, and haſt redeemed vs to God by thy blood out of euery kindred, and tongue, and people, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <hi>and nation:</hi> which are the Elect or inuiſible Church, as they themſelues confeſſe. This is further confirmed and made more euident in the firſt of the <hi>Reuel.</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith that <hi>thoſe whom Chriſt Ieſus loueth and waſheth from their ſinnes in his blood, are Kings and Prieſts vnto God.</hi> But this Chriſt doth onely to the Elect, and Church inuiſible: for them alone hee loueth; their ſinnes onely hee waſheth away: therefore they onely are this kingdome of Prieſtes, or Kings and Prieſts vnto God.<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Peter</hi> telleth vs that the faithfull are this <hi>royall Prieſthood,</hi> and calling them alſo <hi>an holy Prieſthood,</hi> he ſaith that they <hi>offer vp ſpirituall ſacrifice acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But the inuiſible Church (of which ſocietie the faithfull are) onely doth and can offer ſuch ſacrifices: Therefore the inuiſible Church, are this royall Prieſthood, or kingdome of Prieſtes, and not the viſible Church.

                  <hi>They whom Chriſt hath made Kings and Prieſts vnto God his father, being a Kingly Prieſthood, euen a kingdome of Prieſtes, and a holy nation: hauing part in the firſt reſurrection, the ſecond death may haue no power ouer them; but ſit with Chriſt in his throne, euen as hee ouercame, and ſitteth with his Father in his throne.</hi> From your owne words I argue thus againſt you.

For the conuincing of which errors their are no teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in holy Scripture more excellent, as we may appeare by the premiſſes.

               <p>Neither is that ſo fit a title for the viſible Church <hi>the ſheepe of Lord,</hi> ſeeing in the Scriptures ſpecially of the new Teſtament, ordinarily by <hi>ſheepe</hi> are ment the Elect, and Church inuiſible: <hi>I am the doore of the ſheepe,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Communion of Saints 58.</note> Wherby he imployeth that all Chriſts ſheepe ſhall haue life euerlaſting.

They whoſoeuer they be which are the Temple of God, haue the ſpirit of God dwelling in them, whereby they are quickened, and haue the life of God in them, yea are quickned to immortallitie: But the Elect onely haue this ſpirit as your ſelues affirme pag. 34. of your <hi>confeſsion of Faith,</hi> whereby they are quickened as pag. 26. of the ſame booke: therefore the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect onely and inuiſible Church are by your owne doctrine <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> and not the viſible Church.

Finally this is eaſily conuinced by 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Knowe you not that your body is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you, whom you haue of God? And you are not your owne: for you are bought for a price.</hi> Here we ſee that they who are the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, or the Temple of God are ſaide to be redeemed, or <hi>bought with a price:</hi> But the elect onely are redeemed, euen by your owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore they are of the Elect and Church inuiſible who bee <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> and in whome God dwelleth by his Spirit.</p>

               <p>But M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> by three reaſons will proue that this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not to bee vnderſtood of the inuiſible,<note place="margin">Counterp. 158.</note> but of the viſ.

               </p>
               <p>In the tenth Chapter of this booke I haue anſwered this reaſon at large, and ſhewed the vanitie of it: notwithſtanding ſomething I will adde heere.</p>
               <p>Be it granted that <hi>Peter</hi> writ to the viſ. church, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be ſaid againſt it: as that he writeth to them that had <hi>obtained like precious faith</hi> with him, which none but the choſen and of the inuiſ. chureh haue: yet this proues not that this 9. <hi>verſe</hi> is true and to be vnderſtood of the viſ.

               <p>The ſecond reaſon followeth in theſe words: <hi>This which</hi> Peter <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> chap 2.9.10. <hi>is as</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpake of old to the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 19.6.

And by what titles I pray you doth Ieſus declare his loue to the inuiſible Church, if theſe be the <hi>titles</hi> of the viſible? Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe telleth vs, that <hi>whoſoeuer doth his fathers will which is in heauen the ſame is his ſiſter:</hi> But this doe onely they who are of the inuiſible church: They therefore onely are Chriſt his ſiſter. If the viſ. church and members thereof bee Chriſt <hi>his loue,</hi> then none of them ſhall bee damned: For it cannot bee that Ieſus will condemne them whom he loueth. It is the elect likewiſe and inuiſ. church, which being contracted here to Chriſt, ſhall bee married to him the Kings ſonne in the vvorld to come, when they ſhall partake vvith him in glory: And not the viſ. church whereof the greateſt part ſhall be damned, and but a few ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſaued.</p>
               <p>Laſtly (ſay you) the viſ. Church <hi>is the body of Chriſt:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon all thoſe places in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, where mention is made of <hi>Chriſts body,</hi> you expound of the viſible, when they are to be vnderſtood of the inuiſible church, or the vvhole company of the faithfull, which is a part thereof. If the viſ. church be the body of Chriſt, as you tell vs, then euery one of the viſ. church is a member of Chriſt his body, and hath therefore the ſame ſpirit abiding in him, that is in Chriſt Ieſus. For the very ſame ſpirit that dwelleth in Chriſt the head, is from thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued to his body, and all the members thereof. <hi>If any man haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his. But if the ſpirit of him that raiſed vp Ieſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18048:115"/> vp Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies, by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> Rom. 8.9.11. <hi>Hereby wee know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn) that we dwell in him and he in vs:</hi>

                  <hi>becauſe hee hath giuen vs of his ſpirit.</hi> From hence wee learne that Ieſus doth communicate his ſpirit to all his members: ſo as whoſoeuer hath not this ſpirit, bringing forth the like or the ſame effects in him that it did in Chriſt, the ſame is no member of Chriſt, nor part of his body; Chriſt dwelleth not in him, nor hee in Chriſt. As by loue all the members of this body are vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo by the ſpirit of God this body with all the members thereof, are coupled and knit together to the head Chriſt, whereby it receiueth grace, and increaſe of grace, growing vp into Chriſt;<note place="margin">Iohn 1.16. Epheſ. 4.15.16.</note> for the furniture thereof, according to the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall power of this ſpirit, which is in the meaſure of euery part.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.1.</note> This ſpirit is as the iuice that from Chriſt the vine, is conueyed into euery branch. And it is as the ſoule of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, giuing ſpirituall life, to all the members thereof: euen as the ſoule of man doth animate the body, with all the part or members thereof. But euery one of the viſ. Church is not a member of Chriſt his body, foraſmuch as the ſpirit of Chr ſt dwelleth not in euery one of the viſ. church: and therefore the viſ. church is not the body of Chriſt: but ſome other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men there is, which make that body vvhereof Chriſt is the head, and euery particular man of that ſocietie a member thereof. Neither can you deny that which I doe inferre here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, and neceſſarily followeth vpon the former. Namely, if euery one of the viſ. church be a member of the body of Chriſt, then euery one of the viſ. church hath the Spirit of Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him.<note place="margin">Counterp. 128.</note> Nay, your ſelfe M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> confeſſe and vrge this againſt vs, ſaying, That <hi>we cannot poſſibly be members of the body of Chriſt, nor haue him for our head; Being we are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his life and ſpirit.</hi> It reſteth therefore that either you yeeld to the concluſion, That the viſ. church is not the body of Chriſt; or elſe affirme, That euery member of the viſible church hath the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in him.<note place="margin">Apology 44.</note> That euery one of the viſ. church is not a member of Chriſts body, hath already been ſufficiently proued: and is hereby likewiſe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe then none of the viſ.

               <p>The error of theſe men in this particular ſpringeth from hence, that thoſe things which by the Apoſtle are ſpoken <hi>in a certaine reſpect,</hi> and <hi>of a part of the viſible Church,</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>ſimply, and of the whole viſible Church.</hi> And that we may yet further and better ſee both your folly and ſinne herein, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member wee here: Firſt that the viſible Church is a mixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, conſiſting of diuers ſorts of people good and bad, godly and wicked, Saints indeede, and ſinners. Secondly that from thence doe ariſe different kinde of ſpeeches of and concerning the Church, accordingly as God in his word directeth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth his ſpeech to the godly, or wicked in the church. When to the wicked God applyeth and bendeth his ſpeech, reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them, or denouncing iudgement againſt them, becauſe of the multitude of ſuch in the church, he ſpeaketh as if they were all wicked and no godly in it.

If ſuch be members of the miſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, then to be in Chriſt, ingrafted into him, euen a member of his body, bone of his bones, and fleſh of his fleſh, is not a matter greatly to be reioyced in, (ſeeing it may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reprobate) which I hope you abhorre to ſay. If you doe not, ſpeake it out. Then alſo reprobates may be members of the miſticall body of Chriſt.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18048:118"/> the being of a member to an Officer, and denying it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in another place and booke, that all of the viſ. church are members of Chriſt his glorious body: what doe you elſe but contradict your ſelues? But to come nearer vnto you. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the viſible Church is or may be compared to the body of man, and the Officers of the Church to the members thereof thus, or in this reſpect: that as the body being one, hath yet many members, &amp; euery me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber his diſtinct office; the tye to ſee the eare to heare, the noſe to ſmell with, &amp;c. Euen ſo a viſible Church as it were or like a body, hath many officers, euery of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice hauing his diſtinct office. Will you hereupon collect that the viſible Church is the body of Chriſt, the miſticall body (I ſay) of Chriſt? By the ſame reaſon we may conclude that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in Scripture is compared to a body, the ſame is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt. Such collection is very abſurde. And thus much concerning the <hi>titles</hi> which theſe men aſcribe to the viſ. church, and that which is farre worſe with reſpect had to the whole church, as appeareth by their writings: whereas by the holy Ghoſt they are meant and giuen to the inuiſible church, or if to the viſible, it is in reſpect of the Elect which are therein; who onely are the body of Chriſt, his Siſter, his Loue, his Spouſe, &amp;c.</p>

So doing, they worſhip the Diuell, vvhich no man can doe, and the Lord too: If therefore (ſaith in effect the Apoſtle) you deſire to worſhip God, ioyne not vvith your neighbours in their vvorſhip, no not with your bodies, (which hee calleth <hi>fleſh</hi>) reſeruing your ſpirits pure vnto the Lord:<note place="margin">2.

How can one ſeeing ſuch men committing ſinne with greedineſſe, and running headlong in the way to death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the ſame men at the ſame time elect, and to bee of thoſe few which are ordained to life.</p>
               <p>Nay but will they ſay. We doe not deny ſuch to be elect, as are obſtinate ſinners, wee onely hold, that all the members of the viſ. Church are to be accounted elect, <hi>vntill they by obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in ſinne and apoſtacie declare the contrarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But happily ſome will ſay. If we doe not account all of the viſ. Church <hi>Elect, children of God, and of the light:</hi> this is againſt

               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, that it is ſaide likewiſe of charitie: <hi>It reioyceth not in iniquitie, but reioyceth in the trueth.</hi> But to deeme all of the viſible church elect, and therein as it were to ioy, when the Scripture telleth vs cleane otherwiſe, that all of the viſ. church, a fewe excepted, are reprobates: this is not to reioyce in the trueth, nor to iudge according to the trueth. And therfore ſuch iudgement is not agreeing with charitie: To account and ſo to call them the children of God, whoſe workes declare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and the children of light that giue themſelues to the workes of darkeneſſe <hi>is iniquitie:</hi> and no leſſe, then to iuſtifie the wicked, which is an abhomination to the Lord:<note place="margin">Pro. 17.15. Iſa. 5.20.</note> &amp; to think and ſpeake good of euill, to put light for darkeneſſe; and ſweete for ſower; Againſt whom the Prophet pronounceth a fearefull woe. The Scripture teacheth that this is rather <hi>hatred,</hi> then loue. We muſt know therefore that as charitie is not ſuſpitious,<note place="margin">Pro. 13.24.</note> but beleeueth and hopeth the beſt: ſo ſhe is not a foole: but iuditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, iudging of perſons and things wiſely, and as neare as ſhee can according to the trueth.</p>
               <p>But tell mee <hi>M.

If you anſwere affirmatiuely, the ſpeech of Chriſt to their predeceſſors doeth euidently conuince you. If negatiuely, that ſuch are not to bee accounted the children of God, you contradict your ſelfe, and therein acknowledge, that in the viſible church there are ſome children of the diuell: and that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>refore <hi>we may haue religious communion with the children of the diuell:</hi> ſeeing by your owne doctrine wee may haue communion with all the members of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>But leauing theſe, let vs proceede to ſome other. If in the true viſ. Church you ſhould ſee ſuch as the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees; their right ſvcceſſors: would you account and call them <hi>the children of God, of the light, &amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtanding their pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18048:123"/> hypocriſie, and other their abhominations, their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and daily perſecuting of Chriſt in his members? theſe you muſt account and call the chilldren of God, if your doctrine be true. For I truſt you will neither deny that the Scribes and Phariſees were members of the true viſi church, nor that there may bee ſuch in the true Church as well now as in former time.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt giue you to vnderſtand, that <hi>M. Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> in the margent right againſt the aforeſaid lines, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a full Iurie of witneſſes, and ſome to ſpare to prooue as at the firſt bluſh it might ſeeme to ſome, That <hi>the children of God</hi> (of the light and day) <hi>may not entertaine an holy communion with the children of the Diuell.</hi> The ſimple Reader is ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſuch a clowde of witneſſes. And thereupon doubts not of the matter: whereas the witneſſes when they come to ſpeake, eleuen of them ſay not a word to the point, but onely prooue this, that <hi>of men ſome are named the children of god, of the light and day, &amp;c.</hi> Others <hi>the children of men of this world, of the diuell, and of curſe,</hi> as is plaine both by your own words, &amp; by the teſtimonies themſelues. Now herein you might haue ſaued your labour, and rather haue beſtowed more paines in prouing that we deny, then that we grant, But any thing you thinke will ſerue to delude the ſimple.</p>
               <p>Yea but the three laſt teſtimonies, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.25. ſpeake to the iſſue: for they directly prooue, That <hi>the children of God, of the light and day, and the heires of bleſsing, are commaunded to ſeperate from</hi> (meaning in diuine worſhip) <hi>the children of men, of this world, of the diuell, and of curſe: and to entertaine and continue an holy communion among themſelues onely.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>M. Ainſworth</hi> in plaine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes.</p>
               <p>It is true, that in the firſt of theſe places, to the ſonnes and daughters of God this commandement is giuen: <hi>Come out from among them, and ſeperate your ſelues.</hi> But vvho are thoſe of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh and from whom he commandeth the children of God for to ſeperate, and not ioyne with in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip. It is euident they were the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that worſhipped a falſe God. The higheſt degree of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18048:123"/> and moſt groſſe Idolaters that can be. What doth <hi>Paul</hi> now require of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Saints to whom he writ? this. That they ioyne not with theſe idolaters (their neighbours) in their idolatrous and falſe worſhip, nor in any other of their pollutions. This hindreth or prohibiteth not, but that they might communicate with theſe Idolaters in true diuine vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip publike or priuate. But ſuppoſe that this place of <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth all communion with all idolaters in their falſe and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous worſhip, whether they worſhip a falſe and fained god, or the true God falſely, which is all that is forbidden in the word: that letteth not, but that wee may haue religious communion with idolaters in true Diuine worſhip. If then we may lawfully ioyne together with idolaters in the worſhip of God in hearing the word and Prayer, then certainely <hi>with the children of men, of this world, of the Diuell;</hi> and with them that are without, and <hi>no members of the church:</hi> For ſuch as theſe are all Idolaters. Thus wee ſee this Scripture makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for you, and is therefore peruerted by you.</p>
               <p>Let vs now proceede to the next teſtimonie. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>And they continued</hi> (meaning the members of the viſ. Church) <hi>in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This declareth how greatly they of the Church were affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards the word, and worſhip of God, vvherein they did dayly exerciſe themſelues, both in publike and priuate: but neither denyeth nor forbiddeth <hi>all communion in diuine worſhip with them that are without,</hi> no more then this Scripture there following: <hi>And they ſold their poſſeſſions, and goods, and parted them to all men</hi> (of the Church) <hi>as euery one had neede:</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all communicating of our goods, with them which are without. And as well may one from hence conclude, that ſuch as are of the viſible Church may not miniſter vnto the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of them that are without: as this from <hi>ver.</hi> 42. that <hi>they of the viſible Church may haue no religious communion with them that are without.</hi> F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I anſwere: proue and make it plaine to vs: 1. That by <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is ſignified our mutuall partaking in theſe holy things, or in true diuine worſhip, 2. That this polluted perſon doeth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie an open wicked man in the Church.

But if herein you faile: neither this Scripture, nor any of this kinde will auaile you at all. Concerning the firſt of theſe, you ſay: <hi>And this touching, figured our fellowſhip together in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18048:125"/> Church, as the Apoſtle ſheweth:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16, 17.<note place="margin">Communion of Saints 469.</note> I deny this, and affirme that this place of <hi>Paul</hi> prooueth no ſuch thing. The Apo: perſwading the Saints at <hi>Corinth,</hi> not to ioyne with their neighbours (who were heathens and Idolaters) in their falſe and Idolatrous worſhip, nor in any of their polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no, not ſo much as with their bodies, though they kept their ſpirit pure vnto the Lord, vſeth this phraſe in the Lawe, <hi>touch no vncleane thing:</hi> not meaning thereby to teach what this <hi>touching</hi> figured, but the <hi>Corinthian</hi> ſaints that they might no way pertake nor haue any thing to doe, more nor leſſe, ſoule nor body with the Idolatrous worſhip, or any other pollution of theirs. Now what maner of proofe and argument is this? We may not at all pertake with Idolaters in their falſe worſhip; not ſomuch as touch it with a finger: Ergo, not with the open wicked in true diuine worſhip. If wee communicate with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters in falſe worſhip, by touching that impure worſhip, we our ſelues ſhall be made impure; touch it not therefore; come not at it: Ergo, if wee communicate with the open wicked in true diuine worſhip, wee and that worſhtp ſhall be made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. Theſe two concluſions are your poſitions, and the two Antecedents are <hi>Paules:</hi> Let the Reader iudge of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But let vs come to rhe other thing heere to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: that is, whom the man that was ceremonially vncleane did ſignifie. You will not ſay (I knowe) the open wicked man, but the ſinner, without any ſuch limitation or reſtraint. Wherupon (by your expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) this followeth: That the ſinner, or man ſpiritually vncleane, defileth the holy things of God, Word, Sacraments, and Prayer, and they that communicate with him therein are likewiſe defiled: as the man ceremonially vncleane polluted whatſoeuer things he touched, and they that touched him were vncleane.

(much more of diuers) when for the ſame the partie is not cenſured, (as it was for a time with the inceſtuous perſon) is enough by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill example and impunitie, to encourage and drawe others to doe the like. In this ſence is the open ſinne of one when it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnpuniſhed, in danger to ſpread and infect others as doeth a litle leauen ſower the whole lump. And in this ſence the open ſinne of a man may be ſaide to defile others, in being an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to others to commit the like, then I ſay it may be ſaide to defile. But we muſt know that it is not onely the ſinne, but the impunitie alſo thereof, that cauſeth this defilement we ſpeake of. I doe alſo acknowledge, that the open ſinne of a man, and impunitie thereof, defileth them that haue authoritie and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to puniſh the delinquent, and doe it not: that is, maketh them alſo guiltie of ſinne, or to partake in that ſinne. If I ſhould reaſon with you after the ſame manner, and from the ſame or like ground that you doe, ſure you could not chuſe but ſee the vanitie of this your argument.

The reſt of your teſtimonies for breuitie I omit.</p>
               <p>I will not proceede to ſhewe further the vanitie of this your reaſon, but in ſtead thereof will argue againſt your poſition. For if that be falſe, your reaſon alſo is naught.

               <p>With all in the viſible Church it is lawfull to communicate in diuine worſhip.</p>
               <p>But in the viſible Church there be open wicked.</p>

               <p>The propoſition is manifeſt, and ſuch as you your ſelues doe teach.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption I haue already prooued, and that at large: where I ſhew that in the viſible Church there haue beene from time to time, and ſo will be to the ende of the world open wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, &amp;c. My ſecond argument is this. With ſuch as Chriſt hath bid, or permitted his people to communicate in diuine worſhip, we may lawfully haue religious communion.</p>
               <p>But with notorious wicked men, to wit, the Scribes and Phariſees, Chriſt hath bid or permitted, his people to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in diuine worſhip.</p>
               <p>Therefore we notorious wicked men, we may lawfully haue religious communion.</p>
               <p>The propoſition is cleare. The aſſumption is prooued in the 23. of <hi>Matthew: The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes ſeate, whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue, that obſerue and doe.</hi> My third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument followeth.</p>
               <p>With ſuch as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did communicate, the faithfull may lawfully communicate.</p>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> with open wicked men the faithful may lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
               <p>The propoſition, or firſt part of this argument needeth no proofe. The aſſumption is hereby ſtrengthened, in that Ieſus and his Deſciples had religious communion with the Iewes. Their Sinagogus they did vſually frequent.<note place="margin">Luke 2.41.42. and 4.15. Iohn 7.8.10.14 and 18.20. Acts 3.1. &amp; 13.5.14.42. Communion of Saints 328. Counterp. 9.</note> Vnto their ſolemne feaſts held at Ieruſalem they did goe, as the quotations in the margent doe ſhewe. This alſo your ſelues confeſſe, ſaying: <hi>Chriſt often viſited the Temple, and Synagogues, &amp; alſo his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</hi> And againe, <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles communicated with the Church of the Iewes.</hi> But generally the Iewes at that time were openly wicked: with open and knowne wicked perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be, that Ieſus and his Diſciples had religious communion.</p>
               <p>That generally the Iewes, euen that whole nation, (though not euery particular perſon therein) was in the time of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles after him notoriouſly wicked, it remaineth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18048:127"/> that I doe prooue. As the Scripture ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Iſa. 24.2.</note> ſo ordinarily it falleth out: <hi>like Prieſt, like people.</hi> But the Prieſts then were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly wicked, as often hath beene ſhewed in the Scribes and Phariſees. Therefore if not all, yet moſt of the people. This is alſo confirmed by that ſpeech of the Baptiſt:<note place="margin">Matth. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Now is the axe put to the roote of the trees: therefore euery tree which bringeth not foorth good fruite, is hewen downe, and caſt into the fire.</hi> In that he threatneth preſent deſtruction, temporall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall to this people, it doeth argue their intollerable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that they were altogether barren, vnfruitfull, and rotten trees, fit for nothing but the fire: and that their wickednes was ſuch, ſo vniuerſall and ſo great, as the land could not beare, but was readie to ſpewe them out, as a man doeth that which his ſtomacke abhorreth. <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things ſaieth the Lord?

               <p>I anſwere. You ſpeake of euery particular viſible Church, and the Apoſtle here of the inuiſible Church, which is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke or vniuerſall: part whereof is now in heauen, and part on earth, as <hi>verſe</hi> 10.

The inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church and company of the Elect is the body of Chriſt: Your propoſition is: Euery true particular viſible Church is the body of Chriſt. Theſe are different propoſitions, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry babe may ſee, the former of theſe is no proofe of the latter: and that the former being true, this latter may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be falſe, That this Scripture is to bee vnderſtood of the inuiſible Church it is manifeſt by that hath been ſaid: Alſo, by the words next following in <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>which is his body, euen the fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all things.</hi> Whereby we learne, that without the Church here ſpoken of, Chriſt Ieſus doth not account himſelfe full, perfect, and entire: but as it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18048:131"/> were maimed, euen as a head without a body. Such is his loue to this church, and high account of it. But this <hi>fulneſſe</hi> to Chriſt doth the inuiſible Church bring: Of the inuiſible church therefore doth the Apoſtle here ſpeake. And marke how nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the firſt words of your <hi>Propoſition</hi> are vſed here by <hi>Paul.</hi> He ſaith not <hi>euery Church,</hi> as you doe, which might ſeeme to haue implyed that he had ſpoken of the viſ. Church or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: nor <hi>true Church,</hi> which had made it cleare on your ſide: For true cannot fitly be ſaid of the inuiſible Church, foraſmuch as there is no falſe inuiſible Church. Onely the word <hi>Church,</hi> he vſeth without any ſuch addition, which word in holy writ is indifferently vſed for the inuiſible, and viſible Church, as before I haue ſhewed: and here for the inuiſible, as the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide doe manifeſt.

               <p>Whoſe Mediator Chriſt Ieſus is, their King, Prieſt, and Prophet he is:</p>
               <p>But Chriſt Ieſus is the Mediator onely of the elect, or inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church:</p>
               <p>Therefore onely of the elect or inuiſible church is Chriſt Ieſus, King Prieſt, and Prophet. And conſequently not of the viſ. church. Or thus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> of theſe two Arguments, is hereby plaine, in that theſe are the parts of Chriſt his mediation. The <hi>Aſſump. tion</hi> needs no proofe. That this you here teach is falſe, may further be proued by your owne doctrine: and thus.</p>
               <p>Whoſe King, Prieſt, and Prophet Chriſt is, for them in that he is their Prieſt he died, and maketh interceſsion: To them in that he is their King, hee doth apply and make effectuall his prieſthood: Them likewiſe he gouerneth by his word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; them hee defendeth, ſpecially from all ſpirituall enemies,

But Chriſt died for, and maketh interceſsion, hee alſo applyeth his prieſthood onely to the elect, gouerneth by his Word and Spirit, defendeth, and thus highly exalteth the elect alone, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Counterp. 147</note>This may bee proued alſo by M. <hi>Ainſworths</hi> owne words: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>the Church of England hath not Chriſt for the King thereof, becauſe the people of that Church were and are (euen by the confeſsion of our aduerſaries) of all ſorts of people, as well wicked as godly, and ſinnes of all ſorts do abound and raigne among them, that if the good lawes of the common wealth did not repreſſe them, there would be no liuing in peace among them. Such prophane worldly people, are not the ſubiects of Chriſt, his kingdome is not of this world, neither is it for the open wicked, but for the repentant and beleeuing, for the poore in ſpirit, the meeke, the mercifull, the perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, not for perſecuters, haters, and contemners of the truth.</hi> In which words you frame vs this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt your ſelues.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is not King of a prophane worldly people, neither are ſuch his ſubiects but onely of an holy and heauenly people, of the repentant &amp; beleeuing, of the poore in ſpirit, the meeke, the mercifull, the perſecuted for righteouſnes ſake:</p>
               <p>But the elect and inuiſible Church onely are this holy and heauenly people, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Elect therefore and the inuiſible Church onely are the ſubiects of Chriſt, and haue him for their King.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 148.</note>Againe ſay you a little after. <hi>If they had Chriſt for their King, his truth, his word, would make them free, hee would make them alſo Kings and Prieſts vnto God his Father: that howſoeuer the ſuppreſsing &amp; aboliſhing of this vnruly Hierarchie with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abominations is to be left vnto the Magiſtrate who onely hath power from God to execute this vengeance, yet euery man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer his owne ſoule, abſtaining from errour, falſe worſhip, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, popiſh thraldome, &amp; all other euill whatſoeuer, though with affliction, bonds, baniſhment, &amp;c. and ſtand faſt in the libertio wherewith Chriſt hath made him free, without yoke of thraldome.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18048:136"/> For he will reigne in the midſt of his enemies. Satan and ſinne hee hath ſubdued, as for himſelf, ſo for all his people and ſubiects, whom he hath redeemed out of all Satanean &amp; Babylonian bondage, that ſinne ſhould reigne no more ouer them.</hi> Thus I from hence argue againſt you.</p>
               <p>They who haue Chriſt for their King, his truth doth make them free, he makes them alſo Kings and Prieſts vnto God his Father:</p>
               <p>But Chriſt performeth this to the elect and inuiſible church onely, as is plaine by thoſe two teſtimonies your ſelfe quote in the margent, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Reu.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>The elect therefore and inuiſible Church onely haue Chriſt for their King.</p>
               <p>Secondly.</p>
               <p>Their King Chriſt Ieſus is, who abſtaine from errour, falſe-worſhip, and all other euill whatſoeuer, deliuering thus their owne ſoules:</p>
               <p>But the elect and inuiſible Church onely abſtaine from eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry euill way, and deliuer their owne ſoules:</p>
               <p>Therefore the elect onely haue Chriſt Ieſus for their King.</p>
               <p>Thirdly.</p>
               <p>They onely are the people and ſubiects of Chriſt, and haue him for their King, for whom hee hath ſubdued Sathan and ſinne, and whom he hath redeemed out of all Satanean bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, that ſinne ſhould reigne no more ouer them:</p>
               <p>But Chriſt hath ſubdued Sathan and ſinne, onely for the elect and inviſible Church, and them alone hath he redeemed out of all Satanean bondage, that ſinne ſhould reigne no more ouer them:</p>
               <p>Therefore the elect and inuiſible Church onely are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſubiects of Chriſt, and haue him for their King. Thus what you build with the one hand, you put downe apaſe with the other.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.8.11.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18048:137"/> of the viſible church. And as King, hee defendeth it from the enemies thereof for his own glory and name that is called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, &amp; for his elect ſake, that are among them. And laſtly in this reſpect he is alſo King of the viſible church, that theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and enemies of his, that will not ſuffer him to reigne ouer them neither regard his lawes and ſtatutes he will take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them and deſtroy them. Thus I acknowledge our Lord is King of the viſible church, but not ſo, a he is King to them, to whom he is Prieſt and Prophet as you doe affirme. Come we now to the ſecond part of the aforeſaid propoſit on,<note place="margin">Counterp. 141.</note> and to <hi>M. Ainſworth</hi> his 4. argument.</p>

                  </gap>y your propoſition, which to be falſe, I doe thus make manifeſt. If <hi>Chriſt Ieſus be the Prieſt of the viſible Church,</hi> then Chriſt died for the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſible church, and maketh interceſsion for all of that ſocietie: for doubtleſſe hee performed all the parts of his Prieſthood, for them to whom he is a Prieſt If Chriſt now died for the viſible church, then all of the viſible church ſhal be ſaued, and none of them damned: for Chriſts death ſhall be effectual to ſaue all thoſe from perdition, for whom he died, <hi>Who ſhall condemne</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>It is Chriſt which is dead.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.34.</note> Intimating that none of thoſe can poſsibly be damned, for whom Chriſt died. Now the aforeſaide inference is falſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there be many reprobates of the viſible church, for which Chriſt neither dyed nor maketh interceſſion: and therefore is that falſe from whence it is inferred &amp; deduced: Nay I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue this by your owne words. In the 32. p. of your <hi>confeſsion of faith,</hi> thus you write. <hi>Touching his Prieſthood Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared once to put away ſinne, by the offering of himſelfe: and to this ende hath fully performed and ſuffred all thoſe things by which God might be reconciled to his Elect.</hi> From hence I reaſon thus.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt in that he was a Prieſt hath by the oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe taken away the ſinne of the Elect onely, and reconciled
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18048:137"/> vnto God onely the Elect, then is hee the Prieſt onely of the Elect, or inuiſible church:</p>
               <p>But Chriſt in that hee was a Prieſt hath by the oblation of himſelfe taken away the ſinne of the Elect onely, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God onely the Elect:</p>

                  <hi>Moreouer the church of England wanteth part and communion with Chriſt in that propheticall office, which he hath imparted to his people, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power and freedome to witneſſe, profeſſe, practiſe and holde forth the word of life, and all that Chriſt hath commaunded.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludeth he: The church of England hath not Chriſt for the prophet thereof; from hence I reaſon thus.</p>

                  <hi>Theſe Miniſters which haue and execute the miniſtery of a falſe Church, are not the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to bee heard or obeyed as Shepheards of our ſelues.

               <p>
                  <hi>But all the Miniſters of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>haue and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the miniſterie of a falſe Church; for ſo by the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that Church is prooued:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore they are not the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not to be heard or obeyed as Shepheards of our ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon I reaſon thus.</p>
               <p>Theſe Miniſters which haue and execute the Miniſtery of a true Church, are the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be heard and obeyed as Shepheards of our ſoules.

Beſides, Chriſt hath giuen his miniſtery to his owne church, ſo that Chriſts church is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of his miniſtery: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. &amp; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

For the iuſtifying of their ſeparation, they alleadge diuers places of holy Scripture, and ſpecially three, which they take to be very pregnant for them. One of them is taken out of the 19.

This teſtimonie of the Apoſtle proueth only this Antecedent, or firſt part of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and the concluſion here is that which (in the general) you inferre of this Scripture.

To alleadge this Scripture or any ſuch like for the proofe of the aforeſaid concluſion, and the iuſtifying of your <hi>ſeperation,</hi> is a very childiſh part, and to no purpoſe, and yet there is not any thing more vſuall with you. If you will write and ſpeake as beſeemeth but men, and to the point in hand: ſhew vs where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> moueth <hi>the Chriſtians in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus or elſewhere, which were more holy and ſincere then the reſt, to ſeperate from the other Chriſtians, becauſe of ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the externall worſhip of God.</hi> And this may aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſuffice for anſwere to this your ſecond teſtimony of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture. Wherein I haue been the larger, becauſe the wiſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18048:142"/> and conſiderate Reader may from thence receiue an anſwere to the third place of Scripture here alleadged by you taken forth of the 18.

                  <hi>And I ſaw another Angell come downe from heauen, and he cryed out mightily with a lowd voice, ſaying, it is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon that great Citie, and is become the habitation of Diuels, and the hold of all foule ſpirits, and a cage of euery vncleane and hatefull bird.</hi> 4. <hi>And I heard another voice from heauen ſay, Goe out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ye receiue not of her plagues.</hi> Both theſe Scriptures teach and perſwade though by diuers reaſons one &amp; the ſame thing: that is, That <hi>wee muſt ſeparate and goe out from idolaters, and not communicate with them in their idolatrous or idol-worſhip:</hi> and therfore one and the ſame anſwere may ſerue them both. They differ onely in this, that the one ſpeaketh of heathen, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Idolatry, and idolaters condemning all communion with them in externall worſhip. And heare that which before we haue heard wee muſt againe remember, and not forget: That it is one thing when the worſhip of God is corrupted in the ſubſtance and whole body thereof, as it is in the better of theſe worſhips, and another thing when it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in part, as vvith humane ceremonies or ordinances of leſſer moment. With the former of theſe kindes of worſhip we may haue no communion, which theſe two places of holy Scripture doe directly proue, but nothing elſe: With the latter kinde (of which our worſhip is) vve may lawfully communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Thus vve ſee how the principall teſtimonies vvhich out of the ſacred Scriptures the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> produce to vvarrant their ſeparation are falſely applyed, miſerably vvreſted, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by them.

Hereby you intimate that for as much as we walke not in this way, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in by this doore, members into communion, and officers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to offices, therefore our people are not in communion, or bee
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18048:143"/> not members of true viſible Churches, nor our Miniſters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Officers, but meere priuate. That in this way wee walke, and enter into the Church and Miniſtery by this doore, it hath touching the former of theſe beene already made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. True it is that in neither of theſe we haue walked, or doe with that ſtraight foote we ſhould, and that in them wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray humane frailtie: but ſuch as through the mercy of God in Chriſt, nullifies not our Church and Miniſterie: no more then <hi>Iacobs</hi> infirmities in the way hee walked to the bleſſing, hindered him of the bleſſing: Or his faultie entrance into the married eſtate with <hi>Leah,</hi> made a nullitie in their Matrimonie, ſo as they liued perpetually in adultery.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing I am fallen into this point, of <hi>your peruerting and abuſe of Scripture,</hi> and got into this field, (a large one I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe, and able to tyre a horſe) I will goe a fewe ſteppes, or paſes further therein. I take no exception againſt this poſition, but your proofes thereof. In <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am that Way, that Trueth, and that Life:</hi> Our Sauiour ſpeaketh of the way to Heauen, that by him we muſt come thither, if euer wee will bee there; That by him we muſt haue life eternall, elſe we dye eternally. This to be Ieſus his meaning we may eaſily ſee by the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this verſe with the former. Chriſt fortelling his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his Paſſion then approaching, and of his going to Heauen, to prepare a place for them, vſeth thereupon theſe wordes: <hi>And whither I goe yee knowe, and the way yee knowe. Thomas</hi> anſwers <hi>Lord we knowe not whither thou goeſt: how can we knowe the way?</hi> Ieſus replies, <hi>I am that way:</hi> meaning that leades to Heauen, which is the place whither I goe. This is the right ſence and meaning of this Scripture. For our Sauiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning a direct anſwere to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and therefore concerning that way which leadeth to the place whither hee was now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was Heauen, it muſt needes be that he ſpeaketh of the way to Heauen. What meane you now ſpeaking of the <hi>way,</hi> or <hi>entrance into the viſible Church,</hi> to coate this Scripture for confirmation thereof? In the way Ieſus heere ſpeaketh of, the Elect onely and the inuiſible Church doeth walke: for to them alone he is the way. In the way you ſpeake of, the viſible Church, the reprobate as well as the Elect doe walke. All that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18048:143"/> walke in the way Ieſus ſpeaketh of, ſhall be ſaued: But many of thoſe which tread the way you ſpeake of ſhall bee damned. Chriſt Ieſus then &amp; you ſpeake both of diuers ſocieties and of diuers wayes. Indeede you ſpeak of <hi>a way,</hi> and heere that word <hi>way</hi> is vſed. Is that enough? If I were to prooue, that <hi>by Chriſt Ieſus as by a doore wee muſt enter into Heauen:</hi> and for proofe thereof ſhould alleadge, Gen. 6.16. <hi>The doore of the Arke thou ſhalt ſet in the ſide thereof:</hi> Or Gen. 19.6. <hi>Then</hi> Lot <hi>went out at the doore vnto them and ſhut the doore after him:</hi> all men would laugh at me. Be not offended with me. Thus M. <hi>Smith</hi> deale you, M. <hi>Iohnſon, Ainſworth, Robinſon,</hi> and <hi>Barrow</hi> full often in your allegations of Scripture. There is nothing more vſuall with all of you then this, to vnderſtand that of the viſible Church, which by the holy Ghoſt is meant and ſpoken of the inuiſible Church, or ſome members thereof. Heere is Church, and Church; but different Churches, and Societies: mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and members, but of diuers bodies: and therefore the Scriptures concerning one, make not at all for the other. Your quotation of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them with thy trueth; thy word is trueth:</hi> is idle, and to no purpoſe. Ieſus ſpeakes there of his eleuen Apoſtles, (as is euident by the verſes precedent and ſubſequent, ſpecially by the 20. verſe) praying for them to his Father: that ſeeing he was now to ſend them into the world, to Preach the Goſpell to euery crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
